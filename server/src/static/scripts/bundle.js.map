They are caught by surprise by a mysterious figure resembling a bat who fights with them. Commissioner Gordon and the rest of the police arrive on the scene and watch as Batman leaps and swings away. After escaping Arkham Asylum on Christmas Eve, The Joker takes over Gotham's airwaves and terrorizes the city for a crime. He challenges Batman and Robin to find his hidden TV studio and free his hostages — Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock and Summer Gleason — before midnight. When District Attorney Harvey Dent collapses after a meal with his fiancée Pamela Isley and friend Bruce Wayne, doctors discover that he has been poisoned. Batman must find the culprit and the antidote before the DA's time runs out. Batman traces a series of bizarre robberies on the streets of Gotham back to a band of homeless children, who have been raised to do the bidding of their master, the Sewer King. While investigating the disappearances of Gotham's homeless in an undercover disguise, Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and imprisoned in a chain gang mining camp, suffering from amnesia. Alfred must thus track him down, help him escape, and free the rest of the prisoners. Mobster Rupert Thorne attempts to use Harvey Dent's secret split personality to blackmail him. But when Dent meets with Thorne at a chemical plant, \\\"Big Bad Harv\\\" takes over, and the resulting confrontation leads to an explosion that horribly scars half of Dent's face. Harvey Dent, now calling himself Two-Face, resurfaces and starts robbing Rupert Thorne's illegal businesses, preparing for a final confrontation with the crime boss, and Batman must stop his former friend before he and Thorne kill each other. During a fight with Batman over a stolen Fabergé egg, the Penguin incapacitates Batman with poison gas. The Dark Knight is rescued by a teenage amateur detective named Sherman Grant and his friend Roberta, who hide Batman in Sherman's basement long enough for him to recover before the Penguin finds them. Bitter scientist Victor Fries, as Mr. Freeze, attacks several divisions of GothCorp, each time stealing a piece for a secret weapon he intends to build. Batman investigates the connections, and discovers that the start of Freeze's vendetta against GothCorp was a bitter falling out between Fries and GothCorp's CEO, Ferris Boyle (Mark Hamill), during which Boyle almost killed Fries (mutating him into Freeze) and presumably killed Fries' terminally ill wife, Nora. Batman must find a way to bring Boyle to justice before Freeze carries out his revenge. Batman encounters a new cat burglar calling herself Catwoman, and around the same time, meets a woman named Selina Kyle (as Bruce Wayne), to whom he is visibly attracted. When Selina runs into trouble with a terrorist group known as The Red Claw, who want the mountain lion sanctuary she was trying to protect, she decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate. The leader of the Red Claw group (known herself only as Red Claw) attacks a military train and steals a viral plague, which she intends to release in Gotham if she isn't paid a ransom. Can Batman and Catwoman put aside their differences and work together to stop Red Claw before it is too late? Lloyd \\\"Eddie\\\" Ventrix is on the verge of losing his daughter, Kimberly, to his ex-wife, Helen, due to his past as a con artist. Determined not to lose Kimberly, Ventrix dons a suit, stolen from where he used to work while on parole, which grants the user invisibility but also becomes highly toxic, and poses as Kimberly's imaginary friend, Mojo, while stealing jewellery for her. Can Batman solve the mystery crimes and stop Ventrix, and at the same time, save his life, despite the fact that he cannot even see him? Simon Trent, an actor best known for his past role as \\\"The Gray Ghost\\\", is on the verge of bankruptcy thanks to his declining career. To save himself, he sells off all of his Gray Ghost merchandise. Immediately afterwards, a series of crimes related to the old show begin to occur. Batman, having himself been inspired partly by the show to become the crimefighter he now is, goes to Trent for help, and they team up to put an end to the crimes, and also revive Trent's career. Batman investigates a cult, called the Brotherhood, founded by the \\\"mystic\\\" Nostromos after hearing about a number of stories from his colleagues about his ability to predict the future. Batman finds out that Nostromos is actually a con artist who was rigging near-fatal accidents to gain the confidence of Gotham's upper class citizens. Can Batman expose this ruse before it's too late? Bruce Wayne is framed for the attempted murder of Lucius Fox. The real perpetrator is an actor and master of disguise named Matt Hagen, who was disfigured in a car accident years ago. In order to keep his fame, he secretly started working for Roland Daggett, who provides him with a monthly supply of an addictive face cream known as Renuyu (a pun on \\\"Renew You\\\") that can temporarily reshape his face back to normal, and who wants to take Wayne Enterprises over for marketing expansion. For botching the murder, Hagen's supply is cut off, and when he breaks into Daggett's lab for more Renuyu, he pays the price dearly when Daggett's men drench his face in the formula and force him to swallow liters of it to avoid drowning. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is arrested and taken into custody, charged with the assault on Fox. Bruce Wayne is released from prison on bail. Hagen, as it turns out, survived the murder attempt on him, but at a high cost: the formula entered his body and soaked every single one of his cells, turning him into a shape-shifting mutant. With his newfound powers, Hagen, now calling himself Clayface, decides to take his revenge on Daggett and his men. Can Batman bring Daggett to justice and stop Clayface before innocent people are hurt? After a man named Charlie Collins curses at the Joker on the road for bumping him, the Clown Prince of Crime corners him and intimidates him into doing him a \\\"small favor\\\". Two years pass, and the Joker finally decides how to use Charlie: to sneak a bomb into the Peregrinator's Club, where Commissioner Gordon is to give a speech at an award ceremony. Charlie, who merely has to open the door, is skeptical at first, but for the sake of his family, he reluctantly decides to obey. But is the Joker really the type to let someone who insulted him live? Detective Bullock is arrested for kidnapping. Batman, who dislikes Bullock but nevertheless believes him to be a good man, investigates, and discovers the identity of the real criminal: Killer Croc, who harbors a vendetta against Bullock for capturing him once. Can he clear Bullock's name before it is too late? The Scarecrow invents a fear chemical that is activated by adrenaline. Then, he uses it to affect the outcome of athletic events. Whenever a single person becomes agitated, the fear chemical kicks in, turning his excitement to fear. The Scarecrow bets against the sports stars' teams as part of his criminal scheme to scare up some quick cash, and Batman and Robin must foil his plot. After his company goes bankrupt, Temple Fugate becomes the Clock King. Fugate sets out to seek his revenge against the man whom he blames for his misfortunes: Mayor Hamilton Hill. Fugate kidnaps Hill, intending to do away with him to accomplish his revenge. Batman must stop Fugate from carrying out his revenge and save the mayor's life. With the help of arsonists, Roland Daggett plans to destroy Crime Alley and use the land to expand his business empire. But that plan would mean killing the residents or forcing them to abandon their homes. Now, Batman must foil Daggett's plan and try to prove that he is a criminal. Miserable Wayne Industries scientist Jervis Tetch is unable to pursue the girl he loves, Alice the secretary. When she splits up from her boyfriend, he makes an advance and develops a fast friendship with her, until her boyfriend reconciles with her and proposes to her. Enraged, Tetch decides to take matters into his own hands, and dons the mantle of the Mad Hatter, using his mind-control devices to force those who have wronged him all his life to become his mindless slaves. Batman is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum after being exposed to the Scarecrow's fear-inducing gas. Batman knows that the Scarecrow has escaped for the second time and is planning to poison Gotham's water supply with the same fear-inducing gas. Can Batman bring himself to break the law and escape from Arkham before the Scarecrow brings Gotham to its knees? Several rich industrialists are invited to the Eternal Youth Health Spa, and that's where they are last seen before disappearing. The only connection: they had something to do with the death of plants. Bruce Wayne also receives an invitation (although it was one of his greedy directors who nearly made the deal to destroy a rainforest before Bruce forced him to shut the operation down), but Alfred and his \\\"lady friend\\\", Maggie, go in his place. When they do not return, Batman is forced to investigate, discovering that the spa is run by Poison Ivy, and that she has been using a formula to turn the industrialists into humanoid trees, including Alfred and Maggie. Bruce Wayne wakes up one morning to find that his life is completely upside-down: his parents are alive, the Batcave does not exist, Alfred does not remember Robin, and he is engaged to Selina Kyle. However, it doesn't mean that Batman isn't still around, and Bruce starts to wonder what has happened, especially after seeing the characteristics of a dream (such as book and newspaper prints not making sense) inside this new life. Baron Jozek, furious at Batman for humiliating him at a dinner party (over Jozek's underworld connections), hires Josiah Wormwood, a master in setting traps for his victims, to hunt down Batman and bring back the hero's cape and cowl. During a fight with some gangsters at a construction yard, Batman and Robin learn the name of their boss: Billy Marin. While Robin looks forward to going up against Marin, Batman becomes distant, and after a falling out at the Batcave, Batman doesn't allow Robin to accompany him on the search for Marin. Robin investigates on the Batcomputer, and soon realizes that Billy Marin is not the boss' real name. Rather, it is an alias of Tony Zucco, the man who killed his parents (which Batman already knew, but chose not to tell Robin). Will Robin ever trust Batman again? Angered by Batman's deceit, Robin sets out to find Tony Zucco on his own, all the while plagued by the memories of his parents' death and how Bruce took him in as his own son. Eventually, Batman manages to find Zucco at an old amusement park, but breaks his leg during the fight. Robin finally arrives and prepares to kill Zucco in revenge. Can Batman prevent his partner from crossing the line between justice and revenge? Joker creates a toxin that affects only fish, mutating them into Joker fish. Then, he targets innocent men who refuse to copyright his Joker fish. The Joker also captures Harvey Bullock, and Batman must rescue him and foil the Clown Prince of Crime's insane scheme. A mysterious ninja is robbing Wayne Enterprises subsidiaries, and Batman discovers that the ninja is actually his equal in combat. A grudge against Bruce Wayne and skills to match him can only mean one person: Kyodai Ken, an old rival of Wayne's teacher from his days in Japan, and who was thrown out of the dojo after attempting to rob it, only to be stopped by Wayne. Ken, it turns out, wants revenge. Batman must stop Roland Daggett's plan to release a viral plague designed by Professor Milo into Gotham by way of its stray cat population. The case gains new urgency when Catwoman becomes infected with the virus during her search for her missing cat, Isis. Now, Batman must find an antidote to save the woman who loves him most. After a prominent judge is injured during a struggle with some thugs demanding money from her in exchange for a strange tape, Bruce Wayne decides to take a trip to Yucca Springs, a resort where the judge had vacationed, and consult Dr. Hugo Strange, a psychiatrist. Bruce soon learns that Strange has invented a machine that extracts people's darkest secrets from their minds and transfers them to videotape — and now Strange has proof of Bruce's secret identity as Batman, and plans to auction it to three of Gotham's prominent crime bosses. Several robberies take place at major companies, including Wayne Enterprises, and Bruce Wayne, as Batman, discovers the thief to be a mechanical briefcase. Bruce meets with his old friend, Karl Rossum, an expert in robotics who lost his daughter to a vehicle accident years ago. He also meets Rossum's assistant, Randa Duane, and Rossum's ultimate creation: a prototype A.I. known as Holographic Analytical Reciprocating Digital Computer (H.A.R.D.A.C.) Bruce invites Duane to dinner, and around the same time, certain civilians start acting strangely. Most surprising is when Duane unexpectedly leaves Wayne Manor while Bruce is on the phone, and the entire Batcave turns on Batman. Batman manages to free himself from the Batcave's clutches, and brings it back under his control, although he fails to track Duane down. Barbara Gordon approaches Batman to inform him of her father's sudden change in behavior. A brutal fight between Batman and Detective Bullock ensues, during which Batman pushes Bullock onto the Bat Signal, and reveals him to actually be an android, meaning that the real Bullock and James Gordon have gone missing, and Batman knows who the culprit is: H.A.R.D.A.C. Can he stop the evil supercomputer before it's too late? Edward Nygma creates the game The Riddle of the Minotaur and makes millions for the company Competitron. He is then fired by his superior, Daniel Mockridge, who wants the profits for himself. Nygma vows revenge, and two years later, he takes up the mantle of the Riddler and traps Mockridge inside a life-sized version of the Minotaur maze. Batman's sympathy is with Nygma, but he and Robin have to stop him before he kills Mockridge, despite the fact that Mockridge cannot legally be brought to justice. Regardless, Mockridge, despite the resulting rescue, is left in a permanent all-consuming fear of Nygma's return for revenge. Cameron Kaiser builds a casino hotel modeled after the Joker, called \\\"The Joker's Wild\\\". The Joker sees this on the news and, enraged, escapes from Arkham again, with one thought on his mind: destroying the casino, unaware that this is exactly what Kaiser wants him to do as part of an insurance claim. Selina Kyle is kidnapped by the villainous genetic engineer Dr. Emile Dorian and becomes his latest experiment to provide his man-cat hybrid named Tygrus with a mate. Batman learns of this and comes to the island to rescue Selina. He is captured and forced into a deadly game of cat-and-flying mouse as Tygrus hunts Batman through the island's jungles. Batman investigates the appearance of a werewolf-like creature in Gotham, not realizing that the monster happens to be one of Bruce Wayne's associates — Anthony Romulus, ex-Olympic champion. Behind the scheme is twisted chemist Professor Milo. Kyodai Ken kidnaps Kairi, star pupil of Yoru Sensei, the martial arts instructor who taught both Kyodai and Bruce. The ninja's ransom for her is a scroll that teaches the location of the fabled Death Touch. When a giant-sized bat ransacks Gotham harbor, Batman suspects that Dr. Kirk Langstrom is up to his old tricks, taking the Man-Bat formula again. Batman isn't the only one. Kirk's wife, Francine, is so distrustful of her husband that she decides to leave him. After further investigation, Batman discovers that this Man-Bat is not Kirk, but someone else, and thus he shames Francine's father into permanently destroying the formula. The Joker, Killer Croc, the Penguin, Two-Face, and Poison Ivy all meet at a poker table, each telling a tale of times when they almost defeated Batman. At the same time, Harley Quinn is about to kill Catwoman after she rescued Batman from the Joker's electric chair. Veronica Vreeland is looking for a way to create a splash with her next party, and arrives at the idea of having a former criminal in attendance — especially if there is one whose manners would create a stir. The Penguin, who has recently reformed, fits the bill perfectly. In the process of convincing the Penguin to come to her party, Veronica finds she likes the corpulent little guy. For his part, the Penguin begins to fall in love with her, until he overhears that he is merely being used... Seeking to prove once and for all that his is the superior mind, the Riddler lures Batman into a riddle-solving contest inside the virtual reality of a computer game in order to save Commissioner Gordon's life. In the course of solving the riddles and escaping the Riddler's traps, Batman learns that he is able to manipulate the virtual reality landscape much like the Riddler does. On the anniversary of the death of Bruce's parents, Batman accompanies Leslie Thompkins to Crime Alley to place roses on the spot where they were gunned down. Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon is on stakeout to arrest James \\\"The Jazzman\\\" Peake during a drug smuggling ring. Batman had promised to be there, but arrives late to find a gun battle going on. He helps defeat the gangsters and arrest the Jazzman, but at a high cost—Gordon is severely wounded. The incident traumatizes Batman and he contemplates giving up his crime-fighting career, despite the Jazzman escaping prison to carry out his personal vendetta against Gordon (who had sent him to prison six years before). Can Robin help Batman regain his confidence in time to save Gordon? While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows, who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole. But after his identity is mistakenly revealed to Talia, Batman remains off-balance as to where her true loyalties lie. When a small time gang member (Matt Frewer) seemingly kills Batman by accident, he gets involved with gangs all over Gotham, as well as the Joker and Rupert Thorne, none of whom believe his story that everything that is happening is by preposterous happenstance. Clayface is falling apart, literally. His clay-like body is disintegrating. Fortunately, a scientist he knew from his movie star days is working on a remedy. However, Hagen is forced to steal money to pay for the expensive components of the remedy. That is, until one of his targets is Wayne Biomedical Labs... Dr. Matthew Thorne (Joseph Campanella), losing his medical license and forced into becoming the crime doctor by his younger brother, crime boss Rupert Thorne, must perform delicate surgery on Rupert. He can't do it alone, and kidnaps Dr. Leslie Thompkins to assist. Batman discovers Leslie's disappearance, and rushes to track her down - and has an additional interest in Matthew, because he was a medical school classmate of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas. When the glamorous magician Zatanna is framed for a robbery during her act, Batman swings to her defense. Zatanna is grateful, though a little puzzled, by the Dark Knight's commitment to prove her innocence, but the two heroes unite and use the skills her father, Zatara, taught them to expose and combat the culprit: an evil illusionist named Montague Kane. Thanks to a freak accident during a high-speed chase, the Batmobile is virtually demolished. After Batman takes the car to his personal mechanic, Earl Cooper, the Penguin makes his move and tampers with the Batmobile, putting it under his control. When the Joker fires Harley, she tries going on a crime spree of her own, joining up with Poison Ivy, and the two become Gotham's Queens of Crime, much to the Joker's fury. When Commissioner Gordon is framed for taking bribes from Rupert Thorne, his daughter Barbara pleads with Batman to show up at a rally being put on in the commissioner's behalf. But when Batman disappears after finding the person behind the frame-up, Barbara takes the law into her own hands as Batgirl. Robin discovers that Gil Mason is in league with the underworld and goes to investigate him. He encounters Batgirl along the way, and go their separate ways to stop Mason. They then meet again to learn that Gil is working with Two-Face to take out Gordon, and have Batman (as Matches Malone) captured. The Penguin steals an experimental helicopter from an air show, causing an explosion that temporarily blinds Bruce Wayne. Batman knows he won't be able to wait until his vision returns to track the Penguin down, but will he be able to do so without the use of his eyes? When Robin is mysteriously abducted from his college campus, Batman begins a fruitless search... until he is astounded by the sudden appearance in the Batcave of Ra's al Ghul. Ra's quickly reveals that his daughter, Talia, has been abducted under circumstances similar to Robin's, suggesting that the same people are responsible. So begins an uneasy truce between Batman and 'The Demon'. After freeing Talia from her father's clutches and escaping from an avalanche, Batman and Robin follow the only clue they have – the word 'Orpheus'. After discovering that 'Orpheus' is Ra's private satellite that will orbit over the Sahara, the duo travel to the Demon's desert stronghold. There, Batman learns that the satellite is actually a weapon which will explosively destroy all the Lazarus Pits simultaneously throughout the world, destroying all the life that exists. When a Batman impersonator appears in Gotham City, the real Batman deduces that Karl Rossum is somehow involved and confronts the inventor. The other Batman, a duplicate, then shows up and a battle between the two takes place. After the duplicate Batman escapes, it begins its campaign to recreate H.A.R.D.A.C.'s goals of a robotic society. Believing himself to be the reincarnation of Zeus, Maxie Zeus steals an experimental weapon that the government developed. The mad man desires to use the weapon against the people of Gotham City and Batman must put a stop to Maxie's mad plan against the city he loves. A brand-new gang has made its debut committing the slickest crimes ever, thanks to the gang leader, Scarface. It's up to Batman to stop Scarface and his \\\"dummy\\\", the Ventriloquist. Wealthy socialite Veronica Vreeland returns from Central America, bringing tiny handmade dolls for all her friends. According to native legend, once placed under a pillow, the dolls do the sleeper's worrying for them. Unknown to Veronica or her guests, each of the dolls was made by the Mad Hatter, and contains a tiny microchip which plantshypnotic suggestions inside the sleepers' brains. A mysterious bat-like creature terrorizes Gotham City, causing the police force to pursue Batman. The Dark Knight must find the real perpetrator to clear his name. Batman encounters the Scarecrow and attempts to foil his scheme to burn down Gotham University, but in the process is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear gas, and is forced to face his own guilt over the death of his parents. The Joker covers Gotham City in a cloud of laughing gas and begins plundering the crazed city. But after Alfred is infected with the toxin, Batman has added incentive to stop the Joker and acquire an antidote from him before all of Gotham dies with a smile. A botched police operation results in the suspension of those involved: Officer Wilkes, Officer Montoya, and Detective Bullock. Confronted by their superiors, each of them is forced to tell their tale of what happened that night. Mayor Hamilton Hill's miserable son, Jordan, becomes even sadder when his father uses his birthday party as a political gathering, and ends up stowing away in the truck of the party clown hired by Hill for the party, whom he doesn't know is actually the Joker in disguise. It is now up to Batman, whom Mayor Hill distrusts, to rescue the boy before it is too late. While Bruce is in Europe on a Wayne Enterprises business trip, the theft of a jade cat statue occurs at Gotham State University. Barbara Gordon again becomes Batgirl to investigate, only to run into Catwoman, who is also investigating, pointing out that the acid residue used to destroy the security system is not her style. The two team up to find the statue, with Robin tailing them, and things go from bad to worse when Roland Daggett is revealed to be involved. Using microchips stolen from the Mad Hatter, the Joker brainwashes famous comedians into committing crazy crimes in order to ruin their reputations. As it turns out, the comedians are the judges who tossed the Joker out of the Gotham Comedy Competition the year before. Now, the Clown Prince of Crime wants to seek his revenge, and Batman and Robin must foil the Joker's plot. Three wealthy, bored friends of Bruce Wayne decide to seek new thrills by becoming master criminals. As the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture (masters of land, sea and air), the Terrible Trio pick Gotham clean, until they encounter one person who cannot be bought off — Batman. The Riddler is hired to work for a toy company, vowing to turn over a new leaf. But Batman refuses to believe he has changed, and he suspects that the Riddler is still obsessed with outsmarting and defeating him. Now, the Dark Knight must prove that Riddler is still a criminal at heart and send him back to Arkham. The Red Claw organization kidnaps Alfred, seeking a code they need to arm a weapon of mass destruction that Alfred knows from his days as a British secret agent. The Joker steals an atomic bomb, and it is up to Batman and Robin to find and stop him. Since there is no time to spare, the duo enlist the help of Harley Quinn to track Joker down. Throughout the episode, it is briefly discussed how Harley met Joker. The Clock King returns to continue his vendetta against Mayor Hill. This time, the time-obsessed criminal hopes to murder Hill with the help of a stolen invention that allows him to warp time and travel at super-speed. Securing another device from its creator, Batman and Robin take on the Clock King in a furious high-speed battle for the mayor's life. Someone has put a hit out on Gotham's toughest cop, Harvey Bullock. After surviving several near misses, Bullock realizes he has no choice but to ask his arch-rival Batman to help him discover who is behind the murder attempts. During their investigation, Bullock learns that his gruff and mean-spirited manner has created enemies in the unlikeliest of people. Note: This episode won the 1996 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction and Composition. The episode was also adapted from a Chuck Dixon story that was published in Detective Comics #651. Ra's al Ghul narrates a story from his past in which Jonah Hex stops his plan to destroy the transcontinental railroad being completed in 1883, by using a war blimp. Not only has Poison Ivy been released from Arkham Asylum, but she's also married to her doctor and settled down to help him raise his two sons. It would appear that Ivy has gone straight and that her old days as a criminal are over. But wealthy bachelors are being struck down by an unknown toxin, leaving Batman to question Ivy's innocence. Mr. Freeze is kidnapped from his prison cell by aging billionaire Grant Walker. Walker is looking to freeze the world and recreate it according to his own design. Batman and Robin infiltrate the billionaire's underwater city and combat both high-tech robots and Mr. Freeze himself, who has personal reasons to do Walker's bidding and cover the Earth in a new ice age. Note: Walker's plot to freeze the world with a giant cannon was later used in Batman & Robin, where Mr. Freeze uses advanced technology to turn an observatory telescope into a freezing cannon to freeze a part of Gotham City and hold the city to ransom. Also, one of Karl Rossum's toy robots seen in this episode is an obvious tribute to the character \\\"Bat-Mite\\\". Lyle Bolton, the new head of security at Arkham, is fired for his atrocious mistreatment of the inmates. Six months later, Bolton becomes the vigilante Lock-Up, and decides to put who he feels responsible for the ruin of the city behind bars. It's up to Batman and Robin to save his victims. Just before he is to undergo the operation that will restore his sanity, Harvey Dent is kidnapped by a mysterious villain. Batman and Robin split up to nab the criminal behind the scheme to abduct the Dark Knight's old friend. They suspect that either the Penguin or Rupert Thorne may be behind the kidnapping. But is it really the Penguin or Thorne behind the kidnapping? Or is it someone else with a grudge against Harvey? Harley Quinn is released back into society, proved to be sane. After a misunderstanding at a clothing store, however, a snowball of comedic chaos builds around her. Gotham's new DA, Janet Van Dorn, is out to capture Batman, but both she and him end up captured by a gang of criminals instead. They are soon put on a kangaroo trial by the Joker (the judge), Two-Face (the prosecutor), the Ventriloquist (the bailiff), Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, the Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, the Scarecrow, the Riddler, and other criminals. If the defense (Batman and the D.A.) can prove that Batman is not the cause for everyone's turn to crime, they will be set free. When the jury gives the verdict of 'not guilty', the villains have little intention of following through on their deal. Notes: Henry Polic II, the Scarecrow's voice actor, was recuperating from throat surgery during the episode's production, so his character has no dialogue in it. Also, Van Dorn mentions in this episode that Harley Quinn was once a doctor at Arkham before the Joker corrupted her mind; backstory which is later shown in The New Batman Adventures episode \\\"Mad Love\\\". En route to an upstate prison, Killer Croc escapes and leads Batman on a dangerous chase through the wilderness. After throwing Batman temporarily off his trail, the reptile-man takes refuge with a group of retired circus freaks, and convinces them to help him. When Batman arrives, Croc and the freaks band together to capture him. Batman comes face-to-face with his most powerful adversary yet, the chemically-enhanced assassin Bane. Originally hired by Rupert Thorne to kill Batman, Bane plans on taking control of Thorne's criminal empire once Batman is destroyed. It is a fight to the death with all of Gotham in the balance, as Batman takes on the man who has vowed to break the Bat. Anxious to take up her old ways as Catwoman, Selina Kyle joins forces with the Ventriloquist to humiliate socialite Veronica Vreeland. But the real victim is Catwoman herself, who has been secretly set up by Scarface to take the fall for another robbery. Batman has to intercede before the furious feline makes things worse by killing the double-talking Ventriloquist. A washed-up actress named Mary Dahl has become bitter and insane after falling into obscurity and suffering from a disorder that prevents her body from growing to adulthood, thus biologically cursed with literal eternal youth. She kidnaps her TV family, who all led much happier lives and more successful careers than her, and holds them prisoner on the abandoned soundstage of her old show While Robin works fast to free the actors from Baby-Doll's explosive death-trap, Batman pursues the tiny fiend through a deadly carnival funhouse. A mystic Egyptian scroll donated to the Gotham museum by Bruce Wayne is stolen by Ra's al Ghul, and Batman and Talia must join forces to prevent the power-mad Ra's from unlocking the scroll's secrets of life and death. Their quest takes them to a hidden temple deep beneath the Egyptian desert. There, the Dark Knight is forced into a terrifying battle with an ancient Egyptian sorceress.\"},{\"name\":\"bowie\",\"text\":\"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop\\nScrews the

smile\\nLike a Polish wanderer\\nI travel ever onwards to your land\\nAnd were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand\\nYour strange demand\\nTo 'collocate' my mind\\nScares me into gloom\\nYou're too intense\\nI'll have to keep you in your place\\nI've no defence\\nI've got to keep my veil on my face\\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to know me well\\nBut I've got things inside my head\\nThat even I can't face\\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to crash\\nmy walls\\nBut if you take an axe to me\\nYou'll kill another man\\nNot me at all\\nYou're fey, Janine\\nA tripper to the last\\nBut if I catch you standing on my toes\\nI'll have a right to shout you down\\nFor you're a lazy stream\\nIn which my thoughts would drown\\nSo stay, Janine\\nAnd we can glide along\\nI've caught your wings for laughs\\nI'm not obliged to read you statements of the year\\nSo take your glasses off\\nAnd don't act so sincere\\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to know me well\\nBut I've got things inside my head\\nThat even I can't face\\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to crash\\nmy walls\\nBut if you take an axe to me\\nYou'll kill another man\\nNot me at all\\n\\nI recall how we lived\\nOn the corner of a bed\\nAnd we'd speak of a Swedish room\\nOf hessian and wood\\nAnd we'd talk with our eyes\\nOf the sweetness in our lives\\nAnd tomorrows of rich surprise...\\nSome things we could do\\nIn our madness\\nWe burnt one hundred days\\nTime takes time to pass\\nAnd I still hold some ashes to me\\nAn Occasional Dream\\nAnd we'd sleep, oh so close\\nBut not really close our eyes\\n'Tween the sheets of summer\\nbathed in blue...\\nGently weeping nights\\nIt was long, long ago\\nAnd I can't touch your name\\nFor the days of fate\\nwere strong for you...\\nDanced you far from me\\nIn my madness\\nI see your face in mine\\nI keep a photograph\\nIt burns my wall with time\\nTime\\nAn Occasional Dream\\nOf mine\\nAn Occasional Dream\\nOf mine\\nAn Occasional Dream\\nOf mine\\n\\nSolemn faced\\nThe village settles down\\nUndetected by the stars\\nAnd the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep\\nAnd the last thing on his mind\\nIs the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned\\n'Neath the covered wooden shaft\\nFolds the rope\\nInto its bag\\nBlows his pipe of smolders\\nBlankets smoke into the room\\nAnd the day will end for some\\nAs the night begins for one\\nStaring through the message in his eyes\\nLies a solitary son\\nFrom the mountain called Freecloud\\nWhere the eagle dare not fly\\nAnd the patience in his sigh\\nGives no indication\\nFor the townsmen to decide\\nSo the village Dreadful yawns\\nPronouncing gross diversion\\nAs the label for the dog\\nOh \\\"It's the madness in his eyes\\\"\\nAs he breaks the night to cry:\\n\\\"It's really Me\\nReally You\\nAnd really Me\\nIt's so hard for us to really be\\nReally You\\nAnd really Me\\nYou'll lose me though I'm always\\nreally free\\\"\\nAnd the mountain moved its eyes\\nTo the world of realize\\nWhere the snow had saved a place\\nFor the Wild Eyed Boy\\nfrom Freecloud\\nAnd the village Dreadful cried\\nAs the rope began to rise\\nFor the smile stayed on the face\\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy\\nfrom Freecloud\\nAnd the women once proud\\nClutched the heart of the crowd\\nAs the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand\\nAnd the Magic in the stare\\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy said\\n\\\"Stop, Freecloud\\nThey won't think to cut me down\\\"\\nBut the cottages fell\\nLike a playing card hell\\nAnd the tears on the face\\nOf the Wise Boy\\nCame tumbling down\\nTo the rumbling ground\\nAnd the missionary mystic of peace/love\\nStumbled to cry among the clouds\\nKicking back the pebbles\\nFrom the Freecloud mountain\\nTrack.\\n\\nI was walking through the counters of a national concern\\nAnd a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder\\nAnd I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean\\nAs the merchandise exchanged and money roared\\nAnd a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak\\nInto the paper bag at her side\\nAnd her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed\\nSo she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind\\nCrying\\n\\\"God knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod may look the other way today\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod may look the other way today\\\"\\nThen she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag\\nPerspiration trickled down her forehead\\nAnd her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder\\nShe was led away bewildered and amazed\\nThrough her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter\\nAs her escort asked her softly\\nfor her name\\nAnd a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady\\nWho had fainted to the whirling\\nwooden floor\\nCrying\\n\\\"God knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nSurely God won't look\\nthe other way\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nSurely God won't look\\nthe other way\\\"\\n\\nThe Children of the summer's end\\nGathered in the dampened grass\\nWe played Our songs and felt the London sky\\nResting on our hands\\nIt was God's land\\nIt was ragged and naive\\nIt was Heaven\\nTouch, We touched the very soul\\nOf holding each and every life\\nWe claimed the very source of joy ran through\\nIt didn't, but it seemed that way\\nI kissed a lot of people that day\\nOh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon\\nTo paint that love\\nupon a white balloon\\nAnd fly it from\\nthe topest top of all the tops\\nThat man has pushed beyond his brain\\nSatori must be something\\njust the same\\nWe scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size\\nWe talked with tall Venusians passing through\\nAnd Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head\\nAnd away they soared\\nClimbing through\\nthe ivory vibrant cloud\\nSomeone passed some bliss among the crowd\\nAnd We walked back to the road, unchained\\n\\\"The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party.\\\"\\n\\nIn the corner of the morning in the past\\nI would sit and blame the master first and last\\nAll the roads were straight and narrow\\nAnd the prayers were small and yellow\\nAnd the rumour spread that I was aging fast\\nThen I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.\\nAnd I looked and frowned and the monster was me\\nWell, I said hello and I said hello\\nAnd I asked \\\"Why not?\\\" and I replied \\\"I don't know\\\"\\nSo we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be\\nAnd he laughed insane and quipped \\\"KAHLIL GIBRAN\\\"\\nSo I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through\\nFor I realized that God's a young man too\\nSo I said \\\"So long\\\" and I waved \\\"Bye-bye\\\"\\nAnd I smashed my soul and traded my mind\\nGot laid by a young bordello\\nI was vaguely half asleep\\nFor which my reputation swept back home in drag\\nAnd the moral of this magic spell\\nNegotiates my hide\\nWhen God did take my logic for a ride\\n(Riding along)\\nHe swallowed his pride and puckered his lips\\nAnd showed me the leather belt round his hips\\nMy knees were shaking my cheeks aflame\\nHe said \\\"You'll never go down to the Gods again\\\"\\n(Turn around,go back!)\\nHe struck the ground a cavern appeared\\nAnd I smelt the burning pit of fear\\nWe crashed a thousand yards below\\nI said \\\"Do it again, do it again\\\"\\n(Turn around,go back!)\\nHis nebulous body swayed above\\nHis tongue swollen with devil's love\\nThe snake and I, a venom high\\nI said \\\"Do it again, do it again\\\"\\n(Turn around, go back!)\\nBreathe, breathe, breathe deeply\\nAnd I was seething, breathing deeply\\nSpitting sentry, horned and tailed\\nWaiting for you\\n\\nDay after day\\nThey send my

blow\\nTo the far side of town\\nWhere it's pointless to be high\\n'Cause it's such a long way down\\nSo I tell them that\\nI can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm\\nI will do me harm\\nHere I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall\\nI'm not quite right at all...am I?\\nDon't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be\\nJust my librium and me\\nAnd my E.S.T. makes three\\n'Cause I'd rather stay here\\nWith all the madmen\\nThan perish with the sadmen roaming free\\nAnd I'd rather play here\\nWith all the madmen\\nFor I'm quite content they're all as sane as me\\n(Where can the horizon lie\\nWhen a nation hides\\nIts organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim\\nThey must be very dim)\\nDay after day\\nThey take some brain away\\nThen turn my face around\\nTo the far side of

my brain, I will go back again\\nMy God, she shook me cold\\n\\nWe passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when\\nAlthough I wasn't there, he said I was his friend\\nWhich came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes\\nI thought you died alone, a long long time ago\\nOh no, not me\\nI never lost control\\nYou're face to face\\nWith The Man Who Sold The World\\nI laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home\\nI searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed\\nI gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here\\nWe must have died alone, a long long time ago\\nWho knows? not me\\nWe never lost control\\nYou're face to face\\nWith the Man who Sold the World\\n\\nWhen all the world was very young\\nAnd mountain magic heavy hung\\nThe supermen would walk in file\\nGuardians of a loveless isle\\nAnd gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives\\nCould heave nor sigh\\nIn solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life\\nStrange games they would play then\\nNo death for the perfect men\\nLife rolls into one for them\\nSo softly a supergod cries\\nWhere all were minds in uni-thought\\nPower weird by mystics taught\\nNo pain, no joy, no power too great\\nColossal strength to grasp a fate\\nWhere sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers\\nNightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold\\nA man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die\\nTo turn to mold.\\nFar out in the red-sky\\nFar out from the sad eyes\\nStrange, mad celebration\\nSo softly a supergod cries\\nFar out in the red-sky\\nFar out from the sad eyes\\nStrange, mad celebration\\nSo softly a supergod dies\\n\\nI still don't know what I was waiting for\\nAnd my time was running wild\\nA million dead-end streets\\nAnd every time I thought I'd got it made\\nIt seemed the taste was

jealousy.\\n\\nHer public is the noon,\\nHer providence the sun,\\nHer progress by the bee proclaimed\\nIn sovereign, swerveless tune.\\n\\nThe bravest of the host,\\nSurrendering the last,\\nNor even of defeat aware\\nWhen cancelled by the frost.\\n\\n\\nTHE BEE.\\n\\nLike trains of cars on tracks of plush\\nI hear the level bee:\\nA jar across the flowers goes,\\nTheir velvet

gold;\\nHis breast, a single onyx\\nWith chrysoprase, inlaid.\\n\\nHis labor is a chant,\\nHis idleness a tune;\\nOh, for a bee's experience\\nOf clovers and of noon!\\n\\n\\nPresentiment is that long shadow on the lawn\\nIndicative that suns go down;\\nThe notice to the startled grass\\nThat darkness is about to pass.\\n\\n\\nAs children bid the guest good-night,\\nAnd then reluctant turn,\\nMy

again.\\n\\n\\nAngels in the early morning\\nMay be seen the dews among,\\nStooping, plucking, smiling, flying:\\nDo the buds to them belong?\\n\\nAngels when the sun is hottest\\nMay be seen the sands among,\\nStooping, plucking, sighing, flying;\\nParched the flowers they bear along.\\n\\n\\nSo bashful when I spied her,\\nSo pretty, so ashamed!\\nSo hidden in her leaflets,\\nLest anybody find;\\n\\nSo breathless till I passed her,\\nSo helpless when I turned\\nAnd bore her, struggling, blushing,\\nHer simple haunts beyond!\\n\\nFor whom I robbed the dingle,\\nFor whom betrayed the dell,\\nMany will doubtless ask me,\\nBut I shall never tell!\\n\\n\\nTWO WORLDS.\\n\\nIt makes no difference abroad,\\nThe seasons fit the same,\\nThe mornings blossom into noons,\\nAnd split their pods of flame.\\n\\nWild-flowers kindle in the woods,\\nThe brooks brag all the day;\\nNo blackbird bates his jargoning\\nFor passing Calvary.\\n\\nAuto-da-fe and judgment\\nAre nothing to the bee;\\nHis separation from his rose\\nTo him seems misery.\\n\\n\\nTHE MOUNTAIN.\\n\\nThe mountain sat upon the plain\\nIn his eternal chair,\\nHis observation omnifold,\\nHis inquest everywhere.\\n\\nThe seasons prayed around his knees,\\nLike children round a sire:\\nGrandfather of the days is he,\\nOf dawn the ancestor.\\n\\n\\nA DAY.\\n\\nI'll tell you how the sun rose, —\\nA

the sun!\\\"\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBut how he set, I know not.\\nThere seemed a purple stile\\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\\nWere climbing all the while\\n\\nTill when they reached the other side,\\nA dominie in gray\\nPut gently up the evening bars,\\nAnd led the flock away.\\n\\n\\nThe butterfly's assumption-gown,\\nIn chrysoprase apartments hung,\\nThis afternoon put on.\\n\\nHow condescending to descend,\\nAnd be of buttercups the friend\\nIn a New England town!\\n\\n\\nTHE WIND.\\n\\nOf all the sounds despatched abroad,\\nThere's not a charge to me\\nLike that old measure in the boughs,\\nThat phraseless melody\\n\\nThe wind does, working like a hand\\nWhose fingers brush the sky,\\nThen quiver down, with tufts of tune\\nPermitted gods and me.\\n\\nWhen winds go round and round in bands,\\nAnd thrum upon the door,\\nAnd birds take places overhead,\\nTo bear them orchestra,\\n\\nI crave him grace, of summer boughs,\\nIf such an outcast be,\\nHe never heard that fleshless chant\\nRise solemn in the tree,\\n\\nAs if some caravan of sound\\nOn deserts, in the sky,\\nHad broken rank,\\nThen knit, and passed\\nIn seamless company.\\n\\n\\nDEATH AND LIFE.\\n\\nApparently with no surprise\\nTo any happy flower,\\nThe frost beheads it at its play\\nIn accidental power.\\nThe blond assassin passes on,\\nThe sun proceeds unmoved\\nTo measure off another day\\nFor an approving God.\\n\\n\\n'T was later when the summer went\\nThan when the cricket came,\\nAnd yet we knew that gentle clock\\nMeant nought but going home.\\n\\n'T was sooner when

take a backward look.\\n\\nThese are the days when skies put on\\nThe old, old sophistries of June, —\\nA blue and gold mistake.\\n\\nOh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,\\nAlmost thy plausibility\\nInduces my belief,\\n\\nTill ranks of seeds their witness bear,\\nAnd softly through the altered air\\nHurries a timid leaf!\\n\\nOh, sacrament of summer days,\\nOh, last communion in

HIGGINSON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt \\nappreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That \\\"irresistible needle-touch,\\\" as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties. \\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her \\nfriend \\\"H.H.\\\" must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:— \\nMY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \\\"day and generation\\\" that you will not give them light.\\n\\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called \\\"dead\\\" you will be \\nwilling that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . . \\nTruly yours,\\n\\nHELEN JACKSON.\\n\\nThe \\\"portfolios\\\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of \\nnote-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse. \\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first \\nstrong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture. \\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, \\\"I made no verse, but \\none or two, until this winter.\\\"\\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more \\nabrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy. \\nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but \\\"A Country Burial,\\\" \\\"A Thunder-Storm,\\\" \\\"The Humming-Bird,\\\" and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the \\nend,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend. \\nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all \\ninterference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes. \\nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic \\nfitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the \\\"thought-rhyme\\\" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing. \\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the \\nunknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God \\\"an Emersonian self-possession,\\\" it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare. \\nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming \\nof a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence. \\nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. \\nThe coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through \\\"the altered air,\\\" an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence. \\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD.\\n\\nAMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\\n\\nAugust, 1891.\\n\\nMy nosegays are for captives;\\nDim, long-expectant eyes,\\nFingers denied the plucking,\\nPatient till paradise,\\n\\nTo such, if they should whisper\\nOf morning and the moor,\\nThey bear no other errand,\\nAnd I, no other prayer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI. LIFE.\\n\\n\\nI'm nobody! Who are you?\\nAre you nobody, too?\\nThen there 's a pair of us — don't tell!\\nThey 'd banish us, you know.\\n\\nHow dreary to be somebody!\\nHow public, like a frog\\nTo tell your name the livelong day\\nTo an admiring bog!\\n\\n\\nI bring an unaccustomed wine\\nTo lips long parching, next to mine,\\nAnd summon them to drink.\\n\\nCrackling with fever, they essay;\\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\\nAnd come next hour to look.\\n\\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass;\\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas!\\nAre so superfluous cold,\\n\\nI would as soon attempt to warm\\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\\nAges beneath the mould.\\n\\nSome other thirsty there may be\\nTo whom this would have pointed me\\nHad it remained to speak.\\n\\nAnd so I always bear the cup\\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake, —\\n\\nIf, haply, any say to me,\\n\\\"Unto the little, unto me,\\\"\\nWhen I at last awake.\\n\\n\\nThe nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\\nThe heaven we chase\\nLike the June bee\\nBefore the school-boy\\nInvites the race;\\nStoops to an easy clover —\\nDips — evades — teases — deploys;\\nThen to the royal clouds\\nLifts his light pinnace\\nHeedless of the boy\\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\\n\\nHomesick for steadfast honey,\\nAh! the bee flies not\\nThat brews that rare variety.\\n\\n\\nWe play at paste,\\nTill qualified for pearl,\\nThen drop the paste,\\nAnd deem ourself a fool.\\nThe shapes, though, were similar,\\nAnd our new hands\\nLearned gem-tactics\\nPractising sands.\\n\\n\\nI found the phrase to every thought\\nI ever had, but one;\\nAnd that defies me, — as a hand\\nDid try to chalk the sun\\n\\nTo races nurtured in the dark; —\\nHow would your own begin?\\nCan blaze be done in cochineal,\\nOr noon in mazarin?\\n\\n\\nHOPE.\\n\\nHope is the thing with feathers\\nThat perches in the soul,\\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\\nAnd never stops at all,\\n\\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\\nAnd sore must be the storm\\nThat could abash the little bird\\nThat kept so many warm.\\n\\nI 've heard it in the chillest land,\\nAnd on the strangest sea;\\nYet, never, in extremity,\\nIt asked a crumb of me.\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE HEAT.\\n\\nDare you see a soul at the white heat?\\nThen crouch within the door.\\nRed is the fire's common tint;\\nBut when the vivid ore\\n\\nHas sated flame's conditions,\\nIts quivering substance plays\\nWithout a color but the light\\nOf unanointed blaze.\\n\\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\\nWhose anvil's even din\\nStands symbol for the finer forge\\nThat soundless tugs within,\\n\\nRefining these impatient ores\\nWith hammer and with blaze,\\nUntil the designated light\\nRepudiate the forge.\\n\\n\\nTRIUMPHANT.\\n\\nWho never lost, are unprepared\\nA coronet to find;\\nWho never thirsted, flagons\\nAnd cooling tamarind.\\n\\nWho never climbed the weary league —\\nCan such a foot explore\\nThe purple territories\\nOn Pizarro's shore?\\n\\nHow many legions overcome?\\nThe emperor will say.\\nHow many colors taken\\nOn Revolution Day?\\n\\nHow many bullets bearest?\\nThe royal scar hast thou?\\nAngels, write \\\"Promoted\\\"\\nOn this soldier's brow!\\n\\n\\nTHE TEST.\\n\\nI can wade grief,\\nWhole pools of it, —\\nI 'm used to that.\\nBut the least push of joy\\nBreaks up my feet,\\nAnd I tip — drunken.\\nLet no pebble smile,\\n'T was the new liquor, —\\nThat was all!\\n\\nPower is only pain,\\nStranded, through discipline,\\nTill weights will hang.\\nGive balm to giants,\\nAnd they 'll wilt, like men.\\nGive Himmaleh, —\\nThey 'll carry him!\\n\\n\\nESCAPE.\\n\\nI never hear the word \\\"escape\\\"\\nWithout a quicker blood,\\nA sudden expectation,\\nA flying attitude.\\n\\nI never hear of prisons broad\\nBy soldiers battered down,\\nBut I tug childish at my bars, —\\nOnly to fail again!\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPENSATION.\\n\\nFor each ecstatic instant\\nWe must an anguish pay\\nIn keen and quivering ratio\\nTo the ecstasy.\\n\\nFor each beloved hour\\nSharp pittances of years,\\nBitter contested farthings\\nAnd coffers heaped with tears.\\n\\n\\nTHE MARTYRS.\\n\\nThrough the straight pass of suffering\\nThe martyrs even trod,\\nTheir feet upon temptation,\\nTheir faces upon God.\\n\\nA stately, shriven company;\\nConvulsion playing round,\\nHarmless as streaks of meteor\\nUpon a planet's bound.\\n\\nTheir faith the everlasting troth;\\nTheir expectation fair;\\nThe needle to the north degree\\nWades so, through polar air.\\n\\n\\nA PRAYER.\\n\\nI meant to have but modest needs,\\nSuch as content, and heaven;\\nWithin my income these could lie,\\nAnd life and I keep even.\\n\\nBut since the last included both,\\nIt would suffice my prayer\\nBut just for one to stipulate,\\nAnd grace would grant the pair.\\n\\nAnd so, upon this wise I prayed, —\\nGreat Spirit, give to me\\nA heaven not so large as yours,\\nBut large enough for me.\\n\\nA smile suffused Jehovah's face;\\nThe cherubim withdrew;\\nGrave saints stole out to look at me,\\nAnd showed their dimples, too.\\n\\nI left the place with all my might, —\\nMy prayer away I threw;\\nThe quiet ages picked it up,\\nAnd Judgment twinkled, too,\\n\\nThat one so honest be extant\\nAs take the tale for true\\nThat \\\"Whatsoever you shall ask,\\nItself be given you.\\\"\\n\\nBut I, grown shrewder, scan the skies\\nWith a suspicious air, —\\nAs children, swindled for the first,\\nAll swindlers be, infer.\\n\\n\\nThe thought beneath so slight a film\\nIs more distinctly seen, —\\nAs laces just reveal the surge,\\nOr mists the Apennine.\\n\\n\\nThe soul unto itself\\nIs an imperial friend, —\\nOr the most agonizing spy\\nAn enemy could send.\\n\\nSecure against its own,\\nNo treason it can fear;\\nItself its sovereign, of itself\\nThe soul should stand in awe.\\n\\n\\nSurgeons must be very careful\\nWhen they take the knife!\\nUnderneath their fine incisions\\nStirs the culprit, — Life!\\n\\n\\nTHE RAILWAY TRAIN.\\n\\nI like to see it lap the miles,\\nAnd lick the valleys up,\\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\\nAnd then, prodigious, step\\n\\nAround a pile of mountains,\\nAnd, supercilious, peer\\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\\nAnd then a quarry pare\\n\\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\\nComplaining all the while\\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\\nThen chase itself down hill\\n\\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\\nThen, punctual as a star,\\nStop — docile and omnipotent —\\nAt its own

by merchantman,\\nReport was not to me.\\n\\n\\nBY THE SEA.\\n\\nI started early, took my dog,\\nAnd visited the sea;\\nThe mermaids in the basement\\nCame out to look at me,\\n\\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\\nExtended hempen hands,\\nPresuming me to be a mouse\\nAground, upon the sands.\\n\\nBut no man moved me till the tide\\nWent past my simple shoe,\\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\\nAnd past my bodice too,\\n\\nAnd made as he would eat me up\\nAs wholly as a dew\\nUpon a dandelion's sleeve —\\nAnd then I started too.\\n\\nAnd he — he followed close behind;\\nI felt his silver heel\\nUpon my ankle, — then my shoes\\nWould overflow with pearl.\\n\\nUntil we met the solid town,\\nNo man he seemed to know;\\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\\n\\n\\nOLD-FASHIONED.\\n\\nArcturus is his other name, —\\nI'd rather call him star!\\nIt's so unkind of science\\nTo go and interfere!\\n\\nI pull a flower from the woods, —\\nA monster with a glass\\nComputes the stamens in a breath,\\nAnd has her in a class.\\n\\nWhereas I took the butterfly\\nAforetime in my hat,\\nHe sits erect in cabinets,\\nThe clover-bells forgot.\\n\\nWhat once was heaven, is zenith now.\\nWhere I proposed to go\\nWhen time's brief masquerade was done,\\nIs mapped, and charted too!\\n\\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\\nAnd stand upon their heads!\\nI hope I 'm ready for the worst,\\nWhatever prank betides!\\n\\nPerhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!\\nI hope the children there\\nWon't be new-fashioned when I come,\\nAnd laugh at me, and stare!\\n\\nI hope the father in the skies\\nWill lift his little girl, —\\nOld-fashioned, naughty, everything, —\\nOver the stile of pearl!\\n\\n\\nA TEMPEST.\\n\\nAn awful tempest mashed the air,\\nThe clouds were gaunt and few;\\nA black, as of a spectre's cloak,\\nHid heaven and earth from view.\\n\\nThe creatures chuckled on the roofs\\nAnd whistled in the air,\\nAnd shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.\\nAnd swung their frenzied hair.\\n\\nThe morning lit, the birds arose;\\nThe monster's faded eyes\\nTurned slowly to his native coast,\\nAnd peace was Paradise!\\n\\n\\nTHE SEA.\\n\\nAn everywhere of silver,\\nWith ropes of sand\\nTo keep it from effacing\\nThe track called land.\\n\\n\\nIN THE GARDEN.\\n\\nA bird came down the walk:\\nHe did not know I saw;\\nHe bit an angle-worm in halves\\nAnd ate the fellow, raw.\\n\\nAnd then he drank a dew\\nFrom a convenient grass,\\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the wall\\nTo let a beetle pass.\\n\\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\\nThat hurried all abroad, —\\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought;\\nHe stirred his velvet head\\n\\nLike one in danger; cautious,\\nI offered him a crumb,\\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\\nAnd rowed him softer home\\n\\nThan oars divide the ocean,\\nToo silver for a seam,\\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\\nLeap, plashless, as they swim.\\n\\n\\nTHE SNAKE.\\n\\nA narrow fellow in the grass\\nOccasionally rides;\\nYou may have met him, — did you not,\\nHis notice sudden is.\\n\\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\\nA spotted shaft is seen;\\nAnd then it closes at your feet\\nAnd opens further on.\\n\\nHe likes a boggy acre,\\nA floor too cool for corn.\\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\\nI more than once, at morn,\\n\\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\\nUnbraiding in the sun, —\\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\\n\\nSeveral of nature's people\\nI know, and they know me;\\nI feel for them a transport\\nOf cordiality;\\n\\nBut never met this fellow,\\nAttended or alone,\\nWithout a tighter breathing,\\nAnd zero at the bone.\\n\\n\\nTHE MUSHROOM.\\n\\nThe mushroom is the elf of plants,\\nAt evening it is not;\\nAt morning in a truffled hut\\nIt stops upon a spot\\n\\nAs if it tarried always;\\nAnd yet its whole career\\nIs shorter than a snake's delay,\\nAnd fleeter than a tare.\\n\\n'T is vegetation's juggler,\\nThe germ of alibi;\\nDoth like a bubble antedate,\\nAnd like a bubble hie.\\n\\nI feel as if the grass were pleased\\nTo have it intermit;\\nThe surreptitious scion\\nOf summer's circumspect.\\n\\nHad nature any outcast face,\\nCould she a son contemn,\\nHad nature an Iscariot,\\nThat mushroom, — it is him.\\n\\n\\nTHE STORM.\\n\\nThere came a wind like a bugle;\\nIt quivered through the grass,\\nAnd a green chill upon the heat\\nSo ominous did pass\\nWe barred the windows and the doors\\nAs from an emerald ghost;\\nThe doom's electric moccason\\nThat very instant passed.\\nOn a strange mob of panting trees,\\nAnd fences fled away,\\nAnd rivers where the houses ran\\nThe living looked that day.\\nThe bell within the steeple wild\\nThe flying tidings whirled.\\nHow much can come\\nAnd much can go,\\nAnd yet abide the world!\\n\\n\\nTHE SPIDER.\\n\\nA spider sewed at night\\nWithout a light\\nUpon an arc of white.\\nIf ruff it was of dame\\nOr shroud of gnome,\\nHimself, himself inform.\\nOf immortality\\nHis strategy\\nWas physiognomy.\\n\\n\\nI know a place where summer strives\\nWith such a practised frost,\\nShe each year leads her daisies back,\\nRecording briefly, \\\"Lost.\\\"\\n\\nBut when the south wind stirs the pools\\nAnd struggles in the lanes,\\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\\nAnd she pours soft refrains\\n\\nInto the lap of adamant,\\nAnd spices, and the dew,\\nThat stiffens quietly to quartz,\\nUpon her amber shoe.\\n\\n\\nThe one that could repeat the summer day\\nWere greater than itself, though he\\nMinutest of mankind might be.\\nAnd who could reproduce the sun,\\nAt period of going down —\\nThe lingering and the stain, I mean —\\nWhen Orient has been outgrown,\\nAnd Occident becomes unknown,\\nHis name remain.\\n\\n\\nTHE WlND'S VISIT.\\n\\nThe wind tapped like a tired man,\\nAnd like a host, \\\"Come in,\\\"\\nI boldly answered; entered then\\nMy residence within\\n\\nA rapid, footless guest,\\nTo offer whom a chair\\nWere as impossible as hand\\nA sofa to the air.\\n\\nNo bone had he to bind him,\\nHis speech was like the push\\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\\nFrom a superior bush.\\n\\nHis countenance a billow,\\nHis fingers, if he pass,\\nLet go a music, as of tunes\\nBlown tremulous in glass.\\n\\nHe visited, still flitting;\\nThen, like a timid man,\\nAgain he tapped — 't was flurriedly —\\nAnd I became alone.\\n\\n\\nNature rarer uses yellow\\nThan another hue;\\nSaves she all of that for sunsets, —\\nProdigal of blue,\\n\\nSpending scarlet like a woman,\\nYellow she affords\\nOnly scantly and selectly,\\nLike a lover's words.\\n\\n\\nGOSSIP.\\n\\nThe leaves, like women, interchange\\nSagacious confidence;\\nSomewhat of nods, and somewhat of\\nPortentous inference,\\n\\nThe parties in both cases\\nEnjoining secrecy, —\\nInviolable compact\\nTo notoriety.\\n\\n\\nSIMPLICITY.\\n\\nHow happy is the little stone\\nThat rambles in the road alone,\\nAnd doesn't care about careers,\\nAnd exigencies never fears;\\nWhose coat of elemental brown\\nA passing universe put on;\\nAnd independent as the sun,\\nAssociates or glows alone,\\nFulfilling absolute decree\\nIn casual simplicity.\\n\\n\\nSTORM.\\n\\nIt sounded as if the streets were running,\\nAnd then the streets stood still.\\nEclipse was all we could see at the window,\\nAnd awe was all we could feel.\\n\\nBy and by the boldest stole out of his covert,\\nTo see if time was there.\\nNature was in her beryl apron,\\nMixing fresher air.\\n\\n\\nTHE RAT.\\n\\nThe rat is the concisest tenant.\\nHe pays no rent, —\\nRepudiates the obligation,\\nOn schemes intent.\\n\\nBalking our wit\\nTo sound or circumvent,\\nHate cannot harm\\nA foe so reticent.\\n\\nNeither decree\\nProhibits him,\\nLawful as\\nEquilibrium.\\n\\n\\nFrequently the woods are pink,\\nFrequently are brown;\\nFrequently the hills undress\\nBehind my native town.\\n\\nOft a head is crested\\nI was wont to see,\\nAnd as oft a cranny\\nWhere it used to be.\\n\\nAnd the earth, they tell me,\\nOn its axis turned, —\\nWonderful rotation\\nBy but twelve performed!\\n\\n\\nA THUNDER-STORM.\\n\\nThe wind begun to rock the grass\\nWith threatening tunes and low, —\\nHe flung a menace at the earth,\\nA menace at the sky.\\n\\nThe leaves unhooked themselves from trees\\nAnd started all abroad;\\nThe dust did scoop itself like hands\\nAnd throw away the road.\\n\\nThe wagons quickened on the streets,\\nThe thunder hurried slow;\\nThe lightning showed a yellow beak,\\nAnd then a livid claw.\\n\\nThe birds put up the bars to nests,\\nThe cattle fled to barns;\\nThere came one drop of giant rain,\\nAnd then, as if the hands\\n\\nThat held the dams had parted hold,\\nThe waters wrecked the sky,\\nBut overlooked my father's house,\\nJust quartering a tree.\\n\\n\\nWITH FLOWERS.\\n\\nSouth winds jostle them,\\nBumblebees come,\\nHover, hesitate,\\nDrink, and are gone.\\n\\nButterflies pause\\nOn their passage Cashmere;\\nI, softly plucking,\\nPresent them here!\\n\\n\\nSUNSET.\\n\\nWhere ships of purple gently toss\\nOn seas of daffodil,\\nFantastic sailors mingle,\\nAnd then — the wharf is still.\\n\\n\\nShe sweeps with many-colored brooms,\\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\\nCome back, and dust the pond!\\n\\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\\nYou dropped an amber thread;\\nAnd now you 've littered all the East\\nWith duds of emerald!\\n\\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\\nAnd still the aprons fly,\\nTill brooms fade softly into stars —\\nAnd then I come away.\\n\\n\\nLike mighty footlights burned the red\\nAt bases of the trees, —\\nThe far theatricals of day\\nExhibiting to these.\\n\\n'T was universe that did applaud\\nWhile, chiefest of the crowd,\\nEnabled by his royal dress,\\nMyself distinguished God.\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS.\\n\\nBring me the sunset in a cup,\\nReckon the morning's flagons up,\\nAnd say how many dew;\\nTell me how far the morning leaps,\\nTell me what time the weaver sleeps\\nWho spun the breadths of blue!\\n\\nWrite me how many notes there be\\nIn the new robin's ecstasy\\nAmong astonished boughs;\\nHow many trips the tortoise makes,\\nHow many cups the bee partakes, —\\nThe debauchee of dews!\\n\\nAlso, who laid the rainbow's piers,\\nAlso, who leads the docile spheres\\nBy withes of supple blue?\\nWhose fingers string the stalactite,\\nWho counts the wampum of the night,\\nTo see that none is due?\\n\\nWho built this little Alban house\\nAnd shut the windows down so close\\nMy spirit cannot see?\\nWho 'll let me out some gala day,\\nWith implements to fly away,\\nPassing pomposity?\\n\\n\\nTHE JUGGLER OF DAY.\\n\\nBlazing in gold and quenching in purple,\\nLeaping like leopards to the sky,\\nThen at the feet of the old horizon\\nLaying her spotted face, to die;\\n\\nStooping as low as the otter's window,\\nTouching the roof and tinting the barn,\\nKissing her bonnet to the meadow, —\\nAnd the juggler of day is gone!\\n\\n\\nMY CRICKET.\\n\\nFarther in summer than the birds,\\nPathetic from the grass,\\nA minor nation celebrates\\nIts unobtrusive mass.\\n\\nNo ordinance is seen,\\nSo gradual the grace,\\nA pensive custom it becomes,\\nEnlarging loneliness.\\n\\nAntiquest felt at noon\\nWhen August, burning low,\\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\\nRepose to typify.\\n\\nRemit as yet no grace,\\nNo furrow on the glow,\\nYet a druidic difference\\nEnhances nature now.\\n\\n\\nAs imperceptibly as grief\\nThe summer lapsed away, —\\nToo imperceptible, at last,\\nTo seem like perfidy.\\n\\nA quietness distilled,\\nAs twilight long begun,\\nOr Nature, spending with herself\\nSequestered afternoon.\\n\\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\\nThe morning foreign shone, —\\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\\nAs guest who would be gone.\\n\\nAnd thus, without a wing,\\nOr service of a keel,\\nOur summer made her light escape\\nInto the beautiful.\\n\\n\\nIt can't be summer, — that got through;\\nIt 's early yet for spring;\\nThere 's that long town of white to cross\\nBefore the blackbirds sing.\\n\\nIt can't be dying, — it's too rouge, —\\nThe dead shall go in white.\\nSo sunset shuts my question down\\nWith clasps of chrysolite.\\n\\n\\nSUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.\\n\\nThe gentian weaves her fringes,\\nThe maple's loom is red.\\nMy departing blossoms\\nObviate parade.\\n\\nA brief, but patient illness,\\nAn hour to prepare;\\nAnd one, below this morning,\\nIs where the angels are.\\n\\nIt was a short procession, —\\nThe bobolink was there,\\nAn aged bee addressed us,\\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\\n\\nWe trust that she was willing, —\\nWe ask that we may be.\\nSummer, sister, seraph,\\nLet us go with thee!\\n\\nIn the name of the bee\\nAnd of the butterfly\\nAnd of the breeze, amen!\\n\\n\\nFRINGED GENTIAN.\\n\\nGod made a little gentian;\\nIt tried to be a rose\\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\\nBut just before the snows\\nThere came a purple creature\\nThat ravished all the hill;\\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\\nAnd mockery was still.\\nThe frosts were her condition;\\nThe Tyrian would not come\\nUntil the North evoked it.\\n\\\"Creator! shall I bloom?\\\"\\n\\n\\nNOVEMBER.\\n\\nBesides the autumn poets sing,\\nA few prosaic days\\nA little this side of the snow\\nAnd that side of the haze.\\n\\nA few incisive mornings,\\nA few ascetic eyes, —\\nGone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,\\nAnd Mr. Thomson's sheaves.\\n\\nStill is the bustle in the brook,\\nSealed are the spicy valves;\\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\\nThe eyes of many elves.\\n\\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain,\\nMy sentiments to share.\\nGrant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,\\nThy windy will to bear!\\n\\n\\nTHE SNOW.\\n\\nIt sifts from leaden sieves,\\nIt powders all the wood,\\nIt fills with alabaster wool\\nThe wrinkles of the road.\\n\\nIt makes an even face\\nOf mountain and of plain, —\\nUnbroken forehead from the east\\nUnto the east again.\\n\\nIt reaches to the fence,\\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\\nIt flings a crystal veil\\n\\nOn stump and stack and stem, —\\nThe summer's empty room,\\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\\nRecordless, but for them.\\n\\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\\nAs ankles of a queen, —\\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\\nDenying they have been.\\n\\n\\nTHE BLUE JAY.\\n\\nNo brigadier throughout the year\\nSo civic as the jay.\\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\\nWith shrill felicity\\n\\nPursuing winds that censure us\\nA February day,\\nThe brother of the universe\\nWas never blown away.\\n\\nThe snow and he are intimate;\\nI 've often seen them play\\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\\nWith such severity,\\n\\nI felt apology were due\\nTo an insulted sky,\\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\\nTo their temerity.\\n\\nThe pillow of this daring head\\nIs pungent evergreens;\\nHis larder — terse and militant —\\nUnknown, refreshing things;\\n\\nHis character a tonic,\\nHis future a dispute;\\nUnfair an immortality\\nThat leaves this neighbor out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\\n\\n\\nLet down the bars, O Death!\\nThe tired flocks come in\\nWhose bleating ceases to repeat,\\nWhose wandering is done.\\n\\nThine is the stillest night,\\nThine the securest fold;\\nToo near thou art for seeking thee,\\nToo tender to be told.\\n\\n\\nGoing to heaven!\\nI don't know when,\\nPray do not ask me how, —\\nIndeed, I 'm too astonished\\nTo think of answering you!\\nGoing to heaven! —\\nHow dim it sounds!\\nAnd yet it will be done\\nAs sure as flocks go home at night\\nUnto the shepherd's arm!\\n\\nPerhaps you 're going too!\\nWho knows?\\nIf you should get there first,\\nSave just a little place for me\\nClose to the two I lost!\\n\\nThe smallest \\\"robe\\\" will fit me,\\nAnd just a bit of \\\"crown;\\\"\\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\\nWhen we are going home.\\n\\nI 'm glad I don't believe it,\\nFor it would stop my breath,\\nAnd I 'd like to look a little more\\nAt such a curious earth!\\nI am glad they did believe it\\nWhom I have never found\\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\\nI left them in the ground.\\n\\n\\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\\nO Jesus! in the air\\nI know not which thy chamber is, —\\nI 'm knocking everywhere.\\n\\nThou stirrest earthquake in the South,\\nAnd maelstrom in the sea;\\nSay, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\\nHast thou no arm for me?\\n\\n\\nEPITAPH.\\n\\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\\nThe broadest land that grows\\nIs not so ample as the breast\\nThese emerald seams enclose.\\n\\nStep lofty; for this name is told\\nAs far as cannon dwell,\\nOr flag subsist, or fame export\\nHer deathless syllable.\\n\\n\\nMorns like these we parted;\\nNoons like these she rose,\\nFluttering first, then firmer,\\nTo her fair repose.\\n\\nNever did she lisp it,\\nAnd 't was not for me;\\nShe was mute from transport,\\nI, from agony!\\n\\nTill the evening, nearing,\\nOne the shutters drew —\\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\\nAnd this linnet flew!\\n\\n\\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\\nWho, had they lived, had died, but when\\nThey died, vitality begun.\\n\\n\\nI read my sentence steadily,\\nReviewed it with my eyes,\\nTo see that I made no mistake\\nIn its extremest clause, —\\n\\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\\nAnd then the pious form\\nThat \\\"God have mercy\\\" on the soul\\nThe jury voted him.\\n\\nI made my soul familiar\\nWith her extremity,\\nThat at the last it should not be\\nA novel agony,\\n\\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\\nSalute and pass without a hint —\\nAnd there the matter ends.\\n\\n\\nI have not told my garden yet,\\nLest that should conquer me;\\nI have not quite the strength now\\nTo break it to the bee.\\n\\nI will not name it in the street,\\nFor shops would stare, that I,\\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\\nShould have the face to die.\\n\\nThe hillsides must not know it,\\nWhere I have rambled so,\\nNor tell the loving forests\\nThe day that I shall go,\\n\\nNor lisp it at the table,\\nNor heedless by the way\\nHint that within the riddle\\nOne will walk to-day!\\n\\n\\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.\\n\\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\\nLike petals from a rose,\\nWhen suddenly across the June\\nA wind with fingers goes.\\n\\nThey perished in the seamless grass, —\\nNo eye could find the place;\\nBut God on his repealless list\\nCan summon every face.\\n\\n\\nThe only ghost I ever saw\\nWas dressed in mechlin, — so;\\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\\nBut rapid, like the roe;\\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\\n\\nHis conversation seldom,\\nHis laughter like the breeze\\nThat dies away in dimples\\nAmong the pensive trees.\\nOur interview was transient,—\\nOf me, himself was shy;\\nAnd God forbid I look behind\\nSince that appalling day!\\n\\n\\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, —\\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\\nBefore their feet are cold.\\n\\nNever the treasures in her nest\\nThe cautious grave exposes,\\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\\n\\nThis covert have all the children\\nEarly aged, and often cold, —\\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\\n\\n\\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\\nBecome so wondrous dear,\\nAs for the lost we grapple,\\nThough all the rest are here, —\\n\\nIn broken mathematics\\nWe estimate our prize,\\nVast, in its fading ratio,\\nTo our penurious eyes!\\n\\n\\nMEMORIALS.\\n\\nDeath sets a thing significant\\nThe eye had hurried by,\\nExcept a perished creature\\nEntreat us tenderly\\n\\nTo ponder little workmanships\\nIn crayon or in wool,\\nWith \\\"This was last her fingers did,\\\"\\nIndustrious until\\n\\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\\nAnd then 't was put among the dust\\nUpon the closet shelves.\\n\\nA book I have, a friend gave,\\nWhose pencil, here and there,\\nHad notched the place that pleased him, —\\nAt rest his fingers are.\\n\\nNow, when I read, I read not,\\nFor interrupting tears\\nObliterate the etchings\\nToo costly for repairs.\\n\\n\\nI went to heaven, —\\n'T was a small town,\\nLit with a ruby,\\nLathed with down.\\nStiller than the fields\\nAt the full dew,\\nBeautiful as pictures\\nNo man drew.\\nPeople like the moth,\\nOf mechlin, frames,\\nDuties of gossamer,\\nAnd eider names.\\nAlmost contented\\nI could be\\n'Mong such unique\\nSociety.\\n\\n\\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\\nTheir glory nought to me;\\n'T was best imperfect, as it was;\\nI 'm finite, I can't see.\\n\\nThe house of supposition,\\nThe glimmering frontier\\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\\nTo me shows insecure.\\n\\nThe wealth I had contented me;\\nIf 't was a meaner size,\\nThen I had counted it until\\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\\n\\nBetter than larger values,\\nHowever true their show;\\nThis timid life of evidence\\nKeeps pleading, \\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThere is a shame of nobleness\\nConfronting sudden pelf, —\\nA finer shame of ecstasy\\nConvicted of itself.\\n\\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\\nAcknowledged of the brave, —\\nOne more \\\"Ye Blessed\\\" to be told;\\nBut this involves the grave.\\n\\n\\nTRIUMPH.\\n\\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\\nThere 's triumph in the room\\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\\nBy faith is overcome.\\n\\nThere 's triumph of the finer mind\\nWhen truth, affronted long,\\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\\nHer God her only throng.\\n\\nA triumph when temptation's bribe\\nIs slowly handed back,\\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\\nAnd one upon the rack.\\n\\nSeverer triumph, by himself\\nExperienced, who can pass\\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\\nJehovah's countenance!\\n\\n\\nPompless no life can pass away;\\nThe lowliest career\\nTo the same pageant wends its way\\nAs that exalted here.\\nHow cordial is the mystery!\\nThe hospitable pall\\nA \\\"this way\\\" beckons spaciously, —\\nA miracle for all!\\n\\n\\nI noticed people disappeared,\\nWhen but a little child, —\\nSupposed they visited remote,\\nOr settled regions wild.\\n\\nNow know I they both visited\\nAnd settled regions wild,\\nBut did because they died, — a fact\\nWithheld the little child!\\n\\n\\nFOLLOWING.\\n\\nI had no cause to be awake,\\nMy best was gone to sleep,\\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\\nAnd failed to wake them up,\\n\\nBut called the others clear,\\nAnd passed their curtains by.\\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\\nKnock, recollect, for me!\\n\\nI looked at sunrise once,\\nAnd then I looked at them,\\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\\nFor circumstance the same.\\n\\n'T was such an ample peace,\\nIt could not hold a sigh, —\\n'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\\n'T was sunset all the day.\\n\\nSo choosing but a gown\\nAnd taking but a prayer,\\nThe only raiment I should need,\\nI struggled, and was there.\\n\\n\\nIf anybody's friend be dead,\\nIt 's sharpest of the theme\\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\\nAt such and such a time.\\n\\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\\nSome manner of the hair, —\\nA prank nobody knew but them,\\nLost, in the sepulchre.\\n\\nHow warm they were on such a day:\\nYou almost feel the date,\\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\\nThey 're centuries from that.\\n\\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\\nYou try to touch the smile,\\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\\nWhen was it, can you tell,\\n\\nYou asked the company to tea,\\nAcquaintance, just a few,\\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\\nThat don't remember you?\\n\\nPast bows and invitations,\\nPast interview, and vow,\\nPast what ourselves can estimate, —\\nThat makes the quick of woe!\\n\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY.\\n\\nOur journey had advanced;\\nOur feet were almost come\\nTo that odd fork in Being's road,\\nEternity by term.\\n\\nOur pace took sudden awe,\\nOur feet reluctant led.\\nBefore were cities, but between,\\nThe forest of the dead.\\n\\nRetreat was out of hope, —\\nBehind, a sealed route,\\nEternity's white flag before,\\nAnd God at every gate.\\n\\n\\nA COUNTRY BURIAL.\\n\\nAmple make this bed.\\nMake this bed with awe;\\nIn it wait till judgment break\\nExcellent and fair.\\n\\nBe its mattress straight,\\nBe its pillow round;\\nLet no sunrise' yellow noise\\nInterrupt this ground.\\n\\n\\nGOING.\\n\\nOn such a night, or such a night,\\nWould anybody care\\nIf such a little figure\\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\\n\\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\\nThat nobody might know\\nBut that the little figure\\nRocked softer, to and fro?\\n\\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\\nWould anybody sigh\\nThat such a little figure\\nToo sound asleep did lie\\n\\nFor chanticleer to wake it, —\\nOr stirring house below,\\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\\nOr early task to do?\\n\\nThere was a little figure plump\\nFor every little knoll,\\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\\nAnd trudging feet from school.\\n\\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\\nAnd visions vast and small.\\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\\nShould reach so small a goal!\\n\\n\\nEssential oils are wrung:\\nThe attar from the rose\\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\\nIt is the gift of screws.\\n\\nThe general rose decays;\\nBut this, in lady's drawer,\\nMakes summer when the lady lies\\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\\n\\n\\nI lived on dread; to those who know\\nThe stimulus there is\\nIn danger, other impetus\\nIs numb and vital-less.\\n\\nAs 't were a spur upon the soul,\\nA fear will urge it where\\nTo go without the spectre's aid\\nWere challenging despair.\\n\\n\\nIf I should die,\\nAnd you should live,\\nAnd time should gurgle on,\\nAnd morn should beam,\\nAnd noon should burn,\\nAs it has usual done;\\nIf birds should build as early,\\nAnd bees as bustling go, —\\nOne might depart at option\\nFrom enterprise below!\\n'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\\nWhen we with daisies lie,\\nThat commerce will continue,\\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\\nIt makes the parting tranquil\\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\\nConduct the pleasing scene!\\n\\n\\nAT LENGTH.\\n\\nHer final summer was it,\\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\\nIf tenderer industriousness\\nPervaded her, we thought\\n\\nA further force of life\\nDeveloped from within, —\\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\\nAnd made the hurry plain.\\n\\nWe wondered at our blindness, —\\nWhen nothing was to see\\nBut her Carrara guide-post, —\\nAt our stupidity,\\n\\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\\nThe busy darling lay,\\nSo busy was she, finishing,\\nSo leisurely were we!\\n\\n\\nGHOSTS.\\n\\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\\nOne need not be a house;\\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\\nMaterial place.\\n\\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\\nExternal ghost,\\nThan an interior confronting\\nThat whiter host.\\n\\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\\nThe stones achase,\\nThan, moonless, one's own self encounter\\nIn lonesome place.\\n\\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\\nShould startle most;\\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\\nBe horror's least.\\n\\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\\nHe bolts the door,\\nO'erlooking a superior spectre\\nMore near.\\n\\n\\nVANISHED.\\n\\nShe died, — this was the way she died;\\nAnd when her breath was done,\\nTook up her simple wardrobe\\nAnd started for the sun.\\n\\nHer little figure at the gate\\nThe angels must have spied,\\nSince I could never find her\\nUpon the mortal side.\\n\\n\\nPRECEDENCE.\\n\\nWait till the majesty of Death\\nInvests so mean a brow!\\nAlmost a powdered footman\\nMight dare to touch it now!\\n\\nWait till in everlasting robes\\nThis democrat is dressed,\\nThen prate about \\\"preferment\\\"\\nAnd \\\"station\\\" and the rest!\\n\\nAround this quiet courtier\\nObsequious angels wait!\\nFull royal is his retinue,\\nFull purple is his state!\\n\\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\\nTo such a modest clay,\\nSince that my Lord, \\\"the Lord of lords\\\"\\nReceives unblushingly!\\n\\n\\nGONE.\\n\\nWent up a year this evening!\\nI recollect it well!\\nAmid no bells nor bravos\\nThe bystanders will tell!\\nCheerful, as to the village,\\nTranquil, as to repose,\\nChastened, as to the chapel,\\nThis humble tourist rose.\\nDid not talk of returning,\\nAlluded to no time\\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\\nWe might look for him;\\nWas grateful for the roses\\nIn life's diverse bouquet,\\nTalked softly of new species\\nTo pick another day.\\n\\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\\nHands bustled at the moorings —\\nThe crowd respectful grew.\\nAscended from our vision\\nTo countenances new!\\nA difference, a daisy,\\nIs all the rest I knew!\\n\\n\\nREQUIEM.\\n\\nTaken from men this morning,\\nCarried by men to-day,\\nMet by the gods with banners\\nWho marshalled her away.\\n\\nOne little maid from playmates,\\nOne little mind from school, —\\nThere must be guests in Eden;\\nAll the rooms are full.\\n\\nFar as the east from even,\\nDim as the border star, —\\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\\nOur departed are.\\n\\n\\nWhat inn is this\\nWhere for the night\\nPeculiar traveller comes?\\nWho is the landlord?\\nWhere the maids?\\nBehold, what curious rooms!\\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\\nNo brimming tankards flow.\\nNecromancer, landlord,\\nWho are these below?\\n\\n\\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\\nAnd all the dead lie down;\\nIt was not night, for all the bells\\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\\n\\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\\nI felt siroccos crawl, —\\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\\nCould keep a chancel cool.\\n\\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\\nThe figures I have seen\\nSet orderly, for burial,\\nReminded me of mine,\\n\\nAs if my life were shaven\\nAnd fitted to a frame,\\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\\nAnd 't was like midnight, some,\\n\\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\\nAnd space stares, all around,\\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\\nRepeal the beating ground.\\n\\nBut most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —\\nWithout a chance or spar,\\nOr even a report of land\\nTo justify despair.\\n\\n\\nTILL THE END.\\n\\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\\nBecause — because if he should die\\nWhile I was gone, and I — too late —\\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\\n\\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\\nAnd could not bear to shut until\\nThey \\\"noticed\\\" me — they noticed me;\\n\\nIf I should stab the patient faith\\nSo sure I 'd come — so sure I 'd come,\\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\\nTelling my tardy name, —\\n\\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\\nWere useless as next morning's sun,\\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\\n\\n\\nVOID.\\n\\nGreat streets of silence led away\\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\\nNo universe, no laws.\\n\\nBy clocks 't was morning, and for night\\nThe bells at distance called;\\nBut epoch had no basis here,\\nFor period exhaled.\\n\\n\\nA throe upon the features\\nA hurry in the breath,\\nAn ecstasy of parting\\nDenominated \\\"Death,\\\" —\\n\\nAn anguish at the mention,\\nWhich, when to patience grown,\\nI 've known permission given\\nTo rejoin its own.\\n\\n\\nSAVED!\\n\\nOf tribulation these are they\\nDenoted by the white;\\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\\nOf victors designate.\\n\\nAll these did conquer; but the ones\\nWho overcame most times\\nWear nothing commoner than snow,\\nNo ornament but palms.\\n\\nSurrender is a sort unknown\\nOn this superior soil;\\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\\nRemembered as the mile\\n\\nOur panting ankle barely gained\\nWhen night devoured the road;\\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\\nAnd all we said was \\\"Saved\\\"!\\n\\n\\nI think just how my shape will rise\\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\\n\\nI think just how my lips will weigh\\nWith shapeless, quivering prayer\\nThat you, so late, consider me,\\nThe sparrow of your care.\\n\\nI mind me that of anguish sent,\\nSome drifts were moved away\\nBefore my simple bosom broke, —\\nAnd why not this, if they?\\n\\nAnd so, until delirious borne\\nI con that thing, — \\\"forgiven,\\\" —\\nTill with long fright and longer trust\\nI drop my heart, unshriven!\\n\\n\\nTHE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.\\n\\nAfter a hundred years\\nNobody knows the place, —\\nAgony, that enacted there,\\nMotionless as peace.\\n\\nWeeds triumphant ranged,\\nStrangers strolled and spelled\\nAt the lone orthography\\nOf the elder dead.\\n\\nWinds of summer fields\\nRecollect the way, —\\nInstinct picking up the key\\nDropped by memory.\\n\\n\\nLay this laurel on the one\\nToo intrinsic for renown.\\nLaurel! veil your deathless tree, —\\nHim you chasten, that is he!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOEMS\\n\\nby EMILY DICKINSON\\n\\nThird Series\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdited by\\n\\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's all I have to bring to-day,\\nThis, and my heart beside,\\nThis, and my heart, and all the fields,\\nAnd all the meadows wide.\\nBe sure you count, should I forget, —\\nSome one the sum could tell, —\\nThis, and my heart, and all the bees\\nWhich in the clover dwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nI. LIFE.\\n\\n\\nREAL RICHES.\\n\\n'T is little I could care for pearls\\nWho own the ample sea;\\nOr brooches, when the Emperor\\nWith rubies pelteth me;\\n\\nOr gold, who am the Prince of Mines;\\nOr diamonds, when I see\\nA diadem to fit a dome\\nContinual crowning me.\\n\\n\\nSUPERIORITY TO FATE.\\n\\nSuperiority to fate\\nIs difficult to learn.\\n'T is not conferred by any,\\nBut possible to earn\\n\\nA pittance at a time,\\nUntil, to her surprise,\\nThe soul with strict economy\\nSubsists till Paradise.\\n\\n\\nHOPE.\\n\\nHope is a subtle glutton;\\nHe feeds upon the fair;\\nAnd yet, inspected closely,\\nWhat abstinence is there!\\n\\nHis is the halcyon table\\nThat never seats but one,\\nAnd whatsoever is consumed\\nThe same amounts remain.\\n\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRU\\n\\nForbidden fruit a flavor has\\nThat lawful orchards mocks;\\nHow luscious lies the pea within\\nThe pod that Duty locks!\\n\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRU\\n\\nHeaven is what I cannot reach!\\nThe apple on the tree,\\nProvided it do hopeless hang,\\nThat 'heaven' is, to me.\\n\\nThe color on the cruising cloud,\\nThe interdicted ground\\nBehind the hill, the house behind, —\\nThere Paradise is found!\\n\\n\\nA WORD.\\n\\nA word is dead\\nWhen it is said,\\nSome say.\\nI say it just\\nBegins to live\\nThat day.\\n\\n\\nTo venerate the simple days\\nWhich lead the seasons by,\\nNeeds but to remember\\nThat from you or me\\nThey may take the trifle\\nTermed mortality!\\n\\nTo invest existence with a stately air,\\nNeeds but to remember\\nThat the acorn there\\nIs the egg of forests\\nFor the upper air!\\n\\n\\nLIFE'S TRADES.\\n\\nIt's such a little thing to weep,\\nSo short a thing to sigh;\\nAnd yet by trades the size of these\\nWe men and women die!\\n\\n\\nDrowning is not so pitiful\\nAs the attempt to rise.\\nThree times, 't is said, a sinking man\\nComes up to face the skies,\\nAnd then declines forever\\nTo that abhorred abode\\nWhere hope and he part company, —\\nFor he is grasped of God.\\nThe Maker's cordial visage,\\nHowever good to see,\\nIs shunned, we must admit it,\\nLike an adversity.\\n\\n\\nHow still the bells in steeples stand,\\nTill, swollen with the sky,\\nThey leap upon their silver feet\\nIn frantic melody!\\n\\n\\nIf the foolish call them 'flowers,'\\nNeed the wiser tell?\\nIf the savans 'classify' them,\\nIt is just as well!\\n\\nThose who read the Revelations\\nMust not criticise\\nThose who read the same edition\\nWith beclouded eyes!\\n\\nCould we stand with that old Moses\\nCanaan denied, —\\nScan, like him, the stately landscape\\nOn the other side, —\\n\\nDoubtless we should deem superfluous\\nMany sciences\\nNot pursued by learnèd angels\\nIn scholastic skies!\\n\\nLow amid that glad Belles lettres\\nGrant that we may stand,\\nStars, amid profound Galaxies,\\nAt that grand 'Right hand'!\\n\\n\\nA SYLLABLE.\\n\\nCould mortal lip divine\\nThe undeveloped freight\\nOf a delivered syllable,\\n'T would crumble with the weight.\\n\\n\\nPARTING.\\n\\nMy life closed twice before its close;\\nIt yet remains to see\\nIf Immortality unveil\\nA third event to me,\\n\\nSo huge, so hopeless to conceive,\\nAs these that twice befell.\\nParting is all we know of heaven,\\nAnd all we need of hell.\\n\\n\\nASPIRATION.\\n\\nWe never know how high we are\\nTill we are called to rise;\\nAnd then, if we are true to plan,\\nOur statures touch the skies.\\n\\nThe heroism we recite\\nWould be a daily thing,\\nDid not ourselves the cubits warp\\nFor fear to be a king.\\n\\n\\nTHE INEVITABLE.\\n\\nWhile I was fearing it, it came,\\nBut came with less of fear,\\nBecause that fearing it so long\\nHad almost made it dear.\\nThere is a fitting a dismay,\\nA fitting a despair.\\n'Tis harder knowing it is due,\\nThan knowing it is here.\\nThe trying on the utmost,\\nThe morning it is new,\\nIs terribler than wearing it\\nA whole existence through.\\n\\n\\nA BOOK.\\n\\nThere is no frigate like a book\\nTo take us lands away,\\nNor any coursers like a page\\nOf prancing poetry.\\nThis traverse may the poorest take\\nWithout oppress of toll;\\nHow frugal is the chariot\\nThat bears a human soul!\\n\\n\\nWho has not found the heaven below\\nWill fail of it above.\\nGod's residence is next to mine,\\nHis furniture is love.\\n\\n\\nA PORTRAIT.\\n\\nA face devoid of love or grace,\\nA hateful, hard, successful face,\\nA face with which a stone\\nWould feel as thoroughly at ease\\nAs were they old acquaintances, —\\nFirst time together thrown.\\n\\n\\nI HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.\\n\\nI had a guinea golden;\\nI lost it in the sand,\\nAnd though the sum was simple,\\nAnd pounds were in the land,\\nStill had it such a value\\nUnto my frugal eye,\\nThat when I could not find it\\nI sat me down to sigh.\\n\\nI had a crimson robin\\nWho sang full many a day,\\nBut when the woods were painted\\nHe, too, did fly away.\\nTime brought me other robins, —\\nTheir ballads were the same, —\\nStill for my missing troubadour\\nI kept the 'house at hame.'\\n\\nI had a star in heaven;\\nOne Pleiad was its name,\\nAnd when I was not heeding\\nIt wandered from the same.\\nAnd though the skies are crowded,\\nAnd all the night ashine,\\nI do not care about it,\\nSince none of them are mine.\\n\\nMy story has a moral:\\nI have a missing friend, —\\nPleiad its name, and robin,\\nAnd guinea in the sand, —\\nAnd when this mournful ditty,\\nAccompanied with tear,\\nShall meet the eye of traitor\\nIn country far from here,\\nGrant that repentance solemn\\nMay seize upon his mind,\\nAnd he no consolation\\nBeneath the sun may find.\\n\\nNOTE. — This poem may have had, like many others, a\\npersonal origin. It is more than probable that it was\\nsent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty\\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies.\\n\\n\\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON.\\n\\nFrom all the jails the boys and girls\\nEcstatically leap, —\\nBeloved, only afternoon\\nThat prison doesn't keep.\\n\\nThey storm the earth and stun the air,\\nA mob of solid bliss.\\nAlas! that frowns could lie in wait\\nFor such a foe as this!\\n\\n\\n\\nFew get enough, — enough is one;\\nTo that ethereal throng\\nHave not each one of us the right\\nTo stealthily belong?\\n\\n\\nUpon the gallows hung a wretch,\\nToo sullied for the hell\\nTo which the law entitled him.\\nAs nature's curtain fell\\nThe one who bore him tottered in,\\nFor this was woman's son.\\n''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;\\nOh, what a livid boon!\\n\\n\\nTHE LOST THOUGHT.\\n\\nI felt a clearing in my mind\\nAs if my brain had split;\\nI tried to match it, seam by seam,\\nBut could not make them fit.\\n\\nThe thought behind I strove to join\\nUnto the thought before,\\nBut sequence ravelled out of reach\\nLike balls upon a floor.\\n\\n\\nRETICENCE.\\n\\nThe reticent volcano keeps\\nHis never slumbering plan;\\nConfided are his projects pink\\nTo no precarious man.\\n\\nIf nature will not tell the tale\\nJehovah told to her,\\nCan human nature not survive\\nWithout a listener?\\n\\nAdmonished by her buckled lips\\nLet every babbler be.\\nThe only secret people keep\\nIs Immortality.\\n\\n\\nWITH FLOWERS.\\n\\nIf recollecting were forgetting,\\nThen I remember not;\\nAnd if forgetting, recollecting,\\nHow near I had forgot!\\nAnd if to miss were merry,\\nAnd if to mourn were gay,\\nHow very blithe the fingers\\nThat gathered these to-day!\\n\\n\\nThe farthest thunder that I heard\\nWas nearer than the sky,\\nAnd rumbles still, though torrid noons\\nHave lain their missiles by.\\nThe lightning that preceded it\\nStruck no one but myself,\\nBut I would not exchange the bolt\\nFor all the rest of life.\\nIndebtedness to oxygen\\nThe chemist may repay,\\nBut not the obligation\\nTo electricity.\\nIt founds the homes and decks the days,\\nAnd every clamor bright\\nIs but the gleam concomitant\\nOf that waylaying light.\\nThe thought is quiet as a flake, —\\nA crash without a sound;\\nHow life's reverberation\\nIts explanation found!\\n\\n\\nOn the bleakness of my lot\\nBloom I strove to raise.\\nLate, my acre of a rock\\nYielded grape and maize.\\n\\nSoil of flint if steadfast tilled\\nWill reward the hand;\\nSeed of palm by Lybian sun\\nFructified in sand.\\n\\n\\nCONTRAST.\\n\\nA door just opened on a street —\\nI, lost, was passing by —\\nAn instant's width of warmth disclosed,\\nAnd wealth, and company.\\n\\nThe door as sudden shut, and I,\\nI, lost, was passing by, —\\nLost doubly, but by contrast most,\\nEnlightening misery.\\n\\n\\n\\nFRIENDS.\\n\\nAre friends delight or pain?\\nCould bounty but remain\\nRiches were good.\\n\\nBut if they only stay\\nBolder to fly away,\\nRiches are sad.\\n\\n\\n\\nFIRE.\\n\\nAshes denote that fire was;\\nRespect the grayest pile\\nFor the departed creature's sake\\nThat hovered there awhile.\\n\\nFire exists the first in light,\\nAnd then consolidates, —\\nOnly the chemist can disclose\\nInto what carbonates.\\n\\n\\nA MAN.\\n\\nFate slew him, but he did not drop;\\nShe felled — he did not fall —\\nImpaled him on her fiercest stakes —\\nHe neutralized them all.\\n\\nShe stung him, sapped his firm advance,\\nBut, when her worst was done,\\nAnd he, unmoved, regarded her,\\nAcknowledged him a man.\\n\\n\\nVENTURES.\\n\\nFinite to fail, but infinite to venture.\\nFor the one ship that struts the shore\\nMany's the gallant, overwhelmed creature\\nNodding in navies nevermore.\\n\\n\\nGRIEFS.\\n\\nI measure every grief I meet\\nWith analytic eyes;\\nI wonder if it weighs like mine,\\nOr has an easier size.\\n\\nI wonder if they bore it long,\\nOr did it just begin?\\nI could not tell the date of mine,\\nIt feels so old a pain.\\n\\nI wonder if it hurts to live,\\nAnd if they have to try,\\nAnd whether, could they choose between,\\nThey would not rather die.\\n\\nI wonder if when years have piled —\\nSome thousands — on the cause\\nOf early hurt, if such a lapse\\nCould give them any pause;\\n\\nOr would they go on aching still\\nThrough centuries above,\\nEnlightened to a larger pain\\nBy contrast with the love.\\n\\nThe grieved are many, I am told;\\nThe reason deeper lies, —\\nDeath is but one and comes but once,\\nAnd only nails the eyes.\\n\\nThere's grief of want, and grief of cold, —\\nA sort they call 'despair;'\\nThere's banishment from native eyes,\\nIn sight of native air.\\n\\nAnd though I may not guess the kind\\nCorrectly, yet to me\\nA piercing comfort it affords\\nIn passing Calvary,\\n\\nTo note the fashions of the cross,\\nOf those that stand alone,\\nStill fascinated to presume\\nThat some are like my own.\\n\\n\\nI have a king who does not speak;\\nSo, wondering, thro' the hours meek\\nI trudge the day away,—\\nHalf glad when it is night and sleep,\\nIf, haply, thro' a dream to peep\\nIn parlors shut by day.\\n\\nAnd if I do, when morning comes,\\nIt is as if a hundred drums\\nDid round my pillow roll,\\nAnd shouts fill all my childish sky,\\nAnd bells keep saying 'victory'\\nFrom steeples in my soul!\\n\\nAnd if I don't, the little Bird\\nWithin the Orchard is not heard,\\nAnd I omit to pray,\\n'Father, thy will be done' to-day,\\nFor my will goes the other way,\\nAnd it were perjury!\\n\\n\\nDISENCHANTMENT.\\n\\nIt dropped so low in my regard\\nI heard it hit the ground,\\nAnd go to pieces on the stones\\nAt bottom of my mind;\\n\\nYet blamed the fate that fractured, less\\nThan I reviled myself\\nFor entertaining plated wares\\nUpon my silver shelf.\\n\\n\\nLOST FAITH.\\n\\nTo lose one's faith surpasses\\nThe loss of an estate,\\nBecause estates can be\\nReplenished, — faith cannot.\\n\\nInherited with life,\\nBelief but once can be;\\nAnnihilate a single clause,\\nAnd Being's beggary.\\n\\n\\nLOST JOY.\\n\\nI had a daily bliss\\nI half indifferent viewed,\\nTill sudden I perceived it stir, —\\nIt grew as I pursued,\\n\\nTill when, around a crag,\\nIt wasted from my sight,\\nEnlarged beyond my utmost scope,\\nI learned its sweetness right.\\n\\n\\nI worked for chaff, and earning wheat\\nWas haughty and betrayed.\\nWhat right had fields to arbitrate\\nIn matters ratified?\\n\\nI tasted wheat, — and hated chaff,\\nAnd thanked the ample friend;\\nWisdom is more becoming viewed\\nAt distance than at hand.\\n\\n\\nLife, and Death, and Giants\\nSuch as these, are still.\\nMinor apparatus, hopper of the mill,\\nBeetle at the candle,\\nOr a fife's small fame,\\nMaintain by accident\\nThat they proclaim.\\n\\n\\nALPINE GLOW.\\n\\nOur lives are Swiss, —\\nSo still, so cool,\\nTill, some odd afternoon,\\nThe Alps neglect

That April!\\nLock the door!\\nI will not be pursued!\\nHe stayed away a year, to call\\nWhen I am occupied.\\nBut trifles look so trivial\\nAs soon as you have come,\\nThat blame is just as dear as praise\\nAnd praise as mere as blame.\\n\\n\\nMARCH.\\n\\nWe like March, his shoes are purple,\\nHe is new and high;\\nMakes he mud for dog and peddler,\\nMakes he forest dry;\\nKnows the adder's tongue his coming,\\nAnd begets her spot.\\nStands the sun so close and mighty\\nThat our minds are hot.\\nNews is he of all the others;\\nBold it were to die\\nWith the blue-birds buccaneering\\nOn his British sky.\\n\\n\\nDAWN.\\n\\nNot knowing when the dawn will come\\nI open every door;\\nOr has it feathers like a bird,\\nOr billows like a shore?\\n\\n\\nA murmur in the trees to note,\\nNot loud enough for wind;\\nA star not far enough to seek,\\nNor near enough to find;\\n\\nA long, long yellow on the lawn,\\nA hubbub as of feet;\\nNot audible, as ours to us,\\nBut dapperer, more sweet;\\n\\nA hurrying home of little men\\nTo houses unperceived, —\\nAll this, and more, if I should tell,\\nWould never be believed.\\n\\nOf robins in the trundle bed\\nHow many I espy\\nWhose nightgowns could not hide the wings,\\nAlthough I heard them try!\\n\\nBut then I promised ne'er to tell;\\nHow could I break my word?\\nSo go your way and I'll go mine, —\\nNo fear you'll miss the road.\\n\\n\\nMorning is the place for dew,\\nCorn is made at noon,\\nAfter dinner light for flowers,\\nDukes for setting sun!\\n\\n\\nTo my quick ear the leaves conferred;\\nThe bushes they were bells;\\nI could not find a privacy\\nFrom Nature's sentinels.\\n\\nIn cave if I presumed to hide,\\nThe walls began to tell;\\nCreation seemed a mighty crack\\nTo make me visible.\\n\\n\\nA ROSE.\\n\\nA sepal, petal, and a thorn\\nUpon a common summer's morn,\\nA flash of dew, a bee or two,\\nA breeze\\nA caper in the trees, —\\nAnd I'm a rose!\\n\\n\\nHigh from the earth I heard a bird;\\nHe trod upon the trees\\nAs he esteemed them trifles,\\nAnd then he spied a breeze,\\nAnd situated softly\\nUpon a pile of wind\\nWhich in a perturbation\\nNature had left behind.\\nA joyous-going fellow\\nI gathered from his talk,\\nWhich both of benediction\\nAnd badinage partook,\\nWithout apparent burden,\\nI learned, in leafy wood\\nHe was the faithful father\\nOf a dependent brood;\\nAnd this untoward transport\\nHis remedy for care, —\\nA contrast to our respites.\\nHow different we are!\\n\\n\\nCOBWEBS.\\n\\nThe spider as an artist\\nHas never been employed\\nThough his

well!\\nThe water lives so far,\\nLike neighbor from another world\\nResiding in a jar.\\n\\nThe grass does not appear afraid;\\nI often wonder he\\nCan stand so close and look so bold\\nAt what is dread to me.\\n\\nRelated somehow they may be, —\\nThe sedge stands next the sea,\\nWhere he is floorless, yet of fear\\nNo evidence gives he.\\n\\nBut nature is a stranger yet;\\nThe ones that cite her most\\nHave never passed her haunted house,\\nNor simplified her ghost.\\n\\nTo pity those that know her not\\nIs helped by the regret\\nThat those who know her, know her less\\nThe nearer her they get.\\n\\n\\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, —\\nOne clover, and a bee,\\nAnd revery.\\nThe revery alone will do\\nIf bees are few.\\n\\n\\nTHE WIND.\\n\\nIt's like the light, —\\nA fashionless delight\\nIt's like the bee, —\\nA dateless melody.\\n\\nIt's like the woods,\\nPrivate like breeze,\\nPhraseless, yet it stirs\\nThe proudest trees.\\n\\nIt's like the morning, —\\nBest when it's done, —\\nThe everlasting clocks\\nChime noon.\\n\\n\\nA dew sufficed itself\\nAnd satisfied a leaf,\\nAnd felt, 'how vast a destiny!\\nHow trivial is life!'\\n\\nThe sun went out to work,\\nThe day went out to play,\\nBut not again that dew was seen\\nBy physiognomy.\\n\\nWhether by day abducted,\\nOr emptied by the sun\\nInto the sea, in passing,\\nEternally unknown.\\n\\n\\nTHE WOODPECKER.\\n\\nHis bill an auger is,\\nHis head, a cap and frill.\\nHe laboreth at every tree, —\\nA worm his utmost goal.\\n\\n\\nA SNAKE.\\n\\nSweet is the swamp with its secrets,\\nUntil we meet a snake;\\n'T is then we sigh for houses,\\nAnd our departure take\\nAt that enthralling gallop\\nThat only childhood knows.\\nA snake is summer's treason,\\nAnd guile is where it goes.\\n\\n\\nCould I but ride indefinite,\\nAs doth the meadow-bee,\\nAnd visit only where I liked,\\nAnd no man visit me,\\n\\nAnd flirt all day with buttercups,\\nAnd marry whom I may,\\nAnd dwell a little everywhere,\\nOr better, run away\\n\\nWith no police to follow,\\nOr chase me if I do,\\nTill I should jump peninsulas\\nTo get away from you, —\\n\\nI said, but just to be a bee\\nUpon a raft of air,\\nAnd row in nowhere all day long,\\nAnd anchor off the bar,—\\nWhat liberty!

They are caught by surprise by a mysterious figure resembling a bat who fights with them. Commissioner Gordon and the rest of the police arrive on the scene and watch as Batman leaps and swings away. After escaping Arkham Asylum on Christmas Eve, The Joker takes over Gotham's airwaves and terrorizes the city for a crime. He challenges Batman and Robin to find his hidden TV studio and free his hostages — Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock and Summer Gleason — before midnight. When District Attorney Harvey Dent collapses after a meal with his fiancée Pamela Isley and friend Bruce Wayne, doctors discover that he has been poisoned. Batman must find the culprit and the antidote before the DA's time runs out. Batman traces a series of bizarre robberies on the streets of Gotham back to a band of homeless children, who have been raised to do the bidding of their master, the Sewer King. While investigating the disappearances of Gotham's homeless in an undercover disguise, Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and imprisoned in a chain gang mining camp, suffering from amnesia. Alfred must thus track him down, help him escape, and free the rest of the prisoners. Mobster Rupert Thorne attempts to use Harvey Dent's secret split personality to blackmail him. But when Dent meets with Thorne at a chemical plant, \\\"Big Bad Harv\\\" takes over, and the resulting confrontation leads to an explosion that horribly scars half of Dent's face. Harvey Dent, now calling himself Two-Face, resurfaces and starts robbing Rupert Thorne's illegal businesses, preparing for a final confrontation with the crime boss, and Batman must stop his former friend before he and Thorne kill each other. During a fight with Batman over a stolen Fabergé egg, the Penguin incapacitates Batman with poison gas. The Dark Knight is rescued by a teenage amateur detective named Sherman Grant and his friend Roberta, who hide Batman in Sherman's basement long enough for him to recover before the Penguin finds them. Bitter scientist Victor Fries, as Mr. Freeze, attacks several divisions of GothCorp, each time stealing a piece for a secret weapon he intends to build. Batman investigates the connections, and discovers that the start of Freeze's vendetta against GothCorp was a bitter falling out between Fries and GothCorp's CEO, Ferris Boyle (Mark Hamill), during which Boyle almost killed Fries (mutating him into Freeze) and presumably killed Fries' terminally ill wife, Nora. Batman must find a way to bring Boyle to justice before Freeze carries out his revenge. Batman encounters a new cat burglar calling herself Catwoman, and around the same time, meets a woman named Selina Kyle (as Bruce Wayne), to whom he is visibly attracted. When Selina runs into trouble with a terrorist group known as The Red Claw, who want the mountain lion sanctuary she was trying to protect, she decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate. The leader of the Red Claw group (known herself only as Red Claw) attacks a military train and steals a viral plague, which she intends to release in Gotham if she isn't paid a ransom. Can Batman and Catwoman put aside their differences and work together to stop Red Claw before it is too late? Lloyd \\\"Eddie\\\" Ventrix is on the verge of losing his daughter, Kimberly, to his ex-wife, Helen, due to his past as a con artist. Determined not to lose Kimberly, Ventrix dons a suit, stolen from where he used to work while on parole, which grants the user invisibility but also becomes highly toxic, and poses as Kimberly's imaginary friend, Mojo, while stealing jewellery for her. Can Batman solve the mystery crimes and stop Ventrix, and at the same time, save his life, despite the fact that he cannot even see him? Simon Trent, an actor best known for his past role as \\\"The Gray Ghost\\\", is on the verge of bankruptcy thanks to his declining career. To save himself, he sells off all of his Gray Ghost merchandise. Immediately afterwards, a series of crimes related to the old show begin to occur. Batman, having himself been inspired partly by the show to become the crimefighter he now is, goes to Trent for help, and they team up to put an end to the crimes, and also revive Trent's career. Batman investigates a cult, called the Brotherhood, founded by the \\\"mystic\\\" Nostromos after hearing about a number of stories from his colleagues about his ability to predict the future. Batman finds out that Nostromos is actually a con artist who was rigging near-fatal accidents to gain the confidence of Gotham's upper class citizens. Can Batman expose this ruse before it's too late? Bruce Wayne is framed for the attempted murder of Lucius Fox. The real perpetrator is an actor and master of disguise named Matt Hagen, who was disfigured in a car accident years ago. In order to keep his fame, he secretly started working for Roland Daggett, who provides him with a monthly supply of an addictive face cream known as Renuyu (a pun on \\\"Renew You\\\") that can temporarily reshape his face back to normal, and who wants to take Wayne Enterprises over for marketing expansion. For botching the murder, Hagen's supply is cut off, and when he breaks into Daggett's lab for more Renuyu, he pays the price dearly when Daggett's men drench his face in the formula and force him to swallow liters of it to avoid drowning. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is arrested and taken into custody, charged with the assault on Fox. Bruce Wayne is released from prison on bail. Hagen, as it turns out, survived the murder attempt on him, but at a high cost: the formula entered his body and soaked every single one of his cells, turning him into a shape-shifting mutant. With his newfound powers, Hagen, now calling himself Clayface, decides to take his revenge on Daggett and his men. Can Batman bring Daggett to justice and stop Clayface before innocent people are hurt? After a man named Charlie Collins curses at the Joker on the road for bumping him, the Clown Prince of Crime corners him and intimidates him into doing him a \\\"small favor\\\". Two years pass, and the Joker finally decides how to use Charlie: to sneak a bomb into the Peregrinator's Club, where Commissioner Gordon is to give a speech at an award ceremony. Charlie, who merely has to open the door, is skeptical at first, but for the sake of his family, he reluctantly decides to obey. But is the Joker really the type to let someone who insulted him live? Detective Bullock is arrested for kidnapping. Batman, who dislikes Bullock but nevertheless believes him to be a good man, investigates, and discovers the identity of the real criminal: Killer Croc, who harbors a vendetta against Bullock for capturing him once. Can he clear Bullock's name before it is too late? The Scarecrow invents a fear chemical that is activated by adrenaline. Then, he uses it to affect the outcome of athletic events. Whenever a single person becomes agitated, the fear chemical kicks in, turning his excitement to fear. The Scarecrow bets against the sports stars' teams as part of his criminal scheme to scare up some quick cash, and Batman and Robin must foil his plot. After his company goes bankrupt, Temple Fugate becomes the Clock King. Fugate sets out to seek his revenge against the man whom he blames for his misfortunes: Mayor Hamilton Hill. Fugate kidnaps Hill, intending to do away with him to accomplish his revenge. Batman must stop Fugate from carrying out his revenge and save the mayor's life. With the help of arsonists, Roland Daggett plans to destroy Crime Alley and use the land to expand his business empire. But that plan would mean killing the residents or forcing them to abandon their homes. Now, Batman must foil Daggett's plan and try to prove that he is a criminal. Miserable Wayne Industries scientist Jervis Tetch is unable to pursue the girl he loves, Alice the secretary. When she splits up from her boyfriend, he makes an advance and develops a fast friendship with her, until her boyfriend reconciles with her and proposes to her. Enraged, Tetch decides to take matters into his own hands, and dons the mantle of the Mad Hatter, using his mind-control devices to force those who have wronged him all his life to become his mindless slaves. Batman is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum after being exposed to the Scarecrow's fear-inducing gas. Batman knows that the Scarecrow has escaped for the second time and is planning to poison Gotham's water supply with the same fear-inducing gas. Can Batman bring himself to break the law and escape from Arkham before the Scarecrow brings Gotham to its knees? Several rich industrialists are invited to the Eternal Youth Health Spa, and that's where they are last seen before disappearing. The only connection: they had something to do with the death of plants. Bruce Wayne also receives an invitation (although it was one of his greedy directors who nearly made the deal to destroy a rainforest before Bruce forced him to shut the operation down), but Alfred and his \\\"lady friend\\\", Maggie, go in his place. When they do not return, Batman is forced to investigate, discovering that the spa is run by Poison Ivy, and that she has been using a formula to turn the industrialists into humanoid trees, including Alfred and Maggie. Bruce Wayne wakes up one morning to find that his life is completely upside-down: his parents are alive, the Batcave does not exist, Alfred does not remember Robin, and he is engaged to Selina Kyle. However, it doesn't mean that Batman isn't still around, and Bruce starts to wonder what has happened, especially after seeing the characteristics of a dream (such as book and newspaper prints not making sense) inside this new life. Baron Jozek, furious at Batman for humiliating him at a dinner party (over Jozek's underworld connections), hires Josiah Wormwood, a master in setting traps for his victims, to hunt down Batman and bring back the hero's cape and cowl. During a fight with some gangsters at a construction yard, Batman and Robin learn the name of their boss: Billy Marin. While Robin looks forward to going up against Marin, Batman becomes distant, and after a falling out at the Batcave, Batman doesn't allow Robin to accompany him on the search for Marin. Robin investigates on the Batcomputer, and soon realizes that Billy Marin is not the boss' real name. Rather, it is an alias of Tony Zucco, the man who killed his parents (which Batman already knew, but chose not to tell Robin). Will Robin ever trust Batman again? Angered by Batman's deceit, Robin sets out to find Tony Zucco on his own, all the while plagued by the memories of his parents' death and how Bruce took him in as his own son. Eventually, Batman manages to find Zucco at an old amusement park, but breaks his leg during the fight. Robin finally arrives and prepares to kill Zucco in revenge. Can Batman prevent his partner from crossing the line between justice and revenge? Joker creates a toxin that affects only fish, mutating them into Joker fish. Then, he targets innocent men who refuse to copyright his Joker fish. The Joker also captures Harvey Bullock, and Batman must rescue him and foil the Clown Prince of Crime's insane scheme. A mysterious ninja is robbing Wayne Enterprises subsidiaries, and Batman discovers that the ninja is actually his equal in combat. A grudge against Bruce Wayne and skills to match him can only mean one person: Kyodai Ken, an old rival of Wayne's teacher from his days in Japan, and who was thrown out of the dojo after attempting to rob it, only to be stopped by Wayne. Ken, it turns out, wants revenge. Batman must stop Roland Daggett's plan to release a viral plague designed by Professor Milo into Gotham by way of its stray cat population. The case gains new urgency when Catwoman becomes infected with the virus during her search for her missing cat, Isis. Now, Batman must find an antidote to save the woman who loves him most. After a prominent judge is injured during a struggle with some thugs demanding money from her in exchange for a strange tape, Bruce Wayne decides to take a trip to Yucca Springs, a resort where the judge had vacationed, and consult Dr. Hugo Strange, a psychiatrist. Bruce soon learns that Strange has invented a machine that extracts people's darkest secrets from their minds and transfers them to videotape — and now Strange has proof of Bruce's secret identity as Batman, and plans to auction it to three of Gotham's prominent crime bosses. Several robberies take place at major companies, including Wayne Enterprises, and Bruce Wayne, as Batman, discovers the thief to be a mechanical briefcase. Bruce meets with his old friend, Karl Rossum, an expert in robotics who lost his daughter to a vehicle accident years ago. He also meets Rossum's assistant, Randa Duane, and Rossum's ultimate creation: a prototype A.I. known as Holographic Analytical Reciprocating Digital Computer (H.A.R.D.A.C.) Bruce invites Duane to dinner, and around the same time, certain civilians start acting strangely. Most surprising is when Duane unexpectedly leaves Wayne Manor while Bruce is on the phone, and the entire Batcave turns on Batman. Batman manages to free himself from the Batcave's clutches, and brings it back under his control, although he fails to track Duane down. Barbara Gordon approaches Batman to inform him of her father's sudden change in behavior. A brutal fight between Batman and Detective Bullock ensues, during which Batman pushes Bullock onto the Bat Signal, and reveals him to actually be an android, meaning that the real Bullock and James Gordon have gone missing, and Batman knows who the culprit is: H.A.R.D.A.C. Can he stop the evil supercomputer before it's too late? Edward Nygma creates the game The Riddle of the Minotaur and makes millions for the company Competitron. He is then fired by his superior, Daniel Mockridge, who wants the profits for himself. Nygma vows revenge, and two years later, he takes up the mantle of the Riddler and traps Mockridge inside a life-sized version of the Minotaur maze. Batman's sympathy is with Nygma, but he and Robin have to stop him before he kills Mockridge, despite the fact that Mockridge cannot legally be brought to justice. Regardless, Mockridge, despite the resulting rescue, is left in a permanent all-consuming fear of Nygma's return for revenge. Cameron Kaiser builds a casino hotel modeled after the Joker, called \\\"The Joker's Wild\\\". The Joker sees this on the news and, enraged, escapes from Arkham again, with one thought on his mind: destroying the casino, unaware that this is exactly what Kaiser wants him to do as part of an insurance claim. Selina Kyle is kidnapped by the villainous genetic engineer Dr. Emile Dorian and becomes his latest experiment to provide his man-cat hybrid named Tygrus with a mate. Batman learns of this and comes to the island to rescue Selina. He is captured and forced into a deadly game of cat-and-flying mouse as Tygrus hunts Batman through the island's jungles. Batman investigates the appearance of a werewolf-like creature in Gotham, not realizing that the monster happens to be one of Bruce Wayne's associates — Anthony Romulus, ex-Olympic champion. Behind the scheme is twisted chemist Professor Milo. Kyodai Ken kidnaps Kairi, star pupil of Yoru Sensei, the martial arts instructor who taught both Kyodai and Bruce. The ninja's ransom for her is a scroll that teaches the location of the fabled Death Touch. When a giant-sized bat ransacks Gotham harbor, Batman suspects that Dr. Kirk Langstrom is up to his old tricks, taking the Man-Bat formula again. Batman isn't the only one. Kirk's wife, Francine, is so distrustful of her husband that she decides to leave him. After further investigation, Batman discovers that this Man-Bat is not Kirk, but someone else, and thus he shames Francine's father into permanently destroying the formula. The Joker, Killer Croc, the Penguin, Two-Face, and Poison Ivy all meet at a poker table, each telling a tale of times when they almost defeated Batman. At the same time, Harley Quinn is about to kill Catwoman after she rescued Batman from the Joker's electric chair. Veronica Vreeland is looking for a way to create a splash with her next party, and arrives at the idea of having a former criminal in attendance — especially if there is one whose manners would create a stir. The Penguin, who has recently reformed, fits the bill perfectly. In the process of convincing the Penguin to come to her party, Veronica finds she likes the corpulent little guy. For his part, the Penguin begins to fall in love with her, until he overhears that he is merely being used... Seeking to prove once and for all that his is the superior mind, the Riddler lures Batman into a riddle-solving contest inside the virtual reality of a computer game in order to save Commissioner Gordon's life. In the course of solving the riddles and escaping the Riddler's traps, Batman learns that he is able to manipulate the virtual reality landscape much like the Riddler does. On the anniversary of the death of Bruce's parents, Batman accompanies Leslie Thompkins to Crime Alley to place roses on the spot where they were gunned down. Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon is on stakeout to arrest James \\\"The Jazzman\\\" Peake during a drug smuggling ring. Batman had promised to be there, but arrives late to find a gun battle going on. He helps defeat the gangsters and arrest the Jazzman, but at a high cost—Gordon is severely wounded. The incident traumatizes Batman and he contemplates giving up his crime-fighting career, despite the Jazzman escaping prison to carry out his personal vendetta against Gordon (who had sent him to prison six years before). Can Robin help Batman regain his confidence in time to save Gordon? While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows, who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole. But after his identity is mistakenly revealed to Talia, Batman remains off-balance as to where her true loyalties lie. When a small time gang member (Matt Frewer) seemingly kills Batman by accident, he gets involved with gangs all over Gotham, as well as the Joker and Rupert Thorne, none of whom believe his story that everything that is happening is by preposterous happenstance. Clayface is falling apart, literally. His clay-like body is disintegrating. Fortunately, a scientist he knew from his movie star days is working on a remedy. However, Hagen is forced to steal money to pay for the expensive components of the remedy. That is, until one of his targets is Wayne Biomedical Labs... Dr. Matthew Thorne (Joseph Campanella), losing his medical license and forced into becoming the crime doctor by his younger brother, crime boss Rupert Thorne, must perform delicate surgery on Rupert. He can't do it alone, and kidnaps Dr. Leslie Thompkins to assist. Batman discovers Leslie's disappearance, and rushes to track her down - and has an additional interest in Matthew, because he was a medical school classmate of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas. When the glamorous magician Zatanna is framed for a robbery during her act, Batman swings to her defense. Zatanna is grateful, though a little puzzled, by the Dark Knight's commitment to prove her innocence, but the two heroes unite and use the skills her father, Zatara, taught them to expose and combat the culprit: an evil illusionist named Montague Kane. Thanks to a freak accident during a high-speed chase, the Batmobile is virtually demolished. After Batman takes the car to his personal mechanic, Earl Cooper, the Penguin makes his move and tampers with the Batmobile, putting it under his control. When the Joker fires Harley, she tries going on a crime spree of her own, joining up with Poison Ivy, and the two become Gotham's Queens of Crime, much to the Joker's fury. When Commissioner Gordon is framed for taking bribes from Rupert Thorne, his daughter Barbara pleads with Batman to show up at a rally being put on in the commissioner's behalf. But when Batman disappears after finding the person behind the frame-up, Barbara takes the law into her own hands as Batgirl. Robin discovers that Gil Mason is in league with the underworld and goes to investigate him. He encounters Batgirl along the way, and go their separate ways to stop Mason. They then meet again to learn that Gil is working with Two-Face to take out Gordon, and have Batman (as Matches Malone) captured. The Penguin steals an experimental helicopter from an air show, causing an explosion that temporarily blinds Bruce Wayne. Batman knows he won't be able to wait until his vision returns to track the Penguin down, but will he be able to do so without the use of his eyes? When Robin is mysteriously abducted from his college campus, Batman begins a fruitless search... until he is astounded by the sudden appearance in the Batcave of Ra's al Ghul. Ra's quickly reveals that his daughter, Talia, has been abducted under circumstances similar to Robin's, suggesting that the same people are responsible. So begins an uneasy truce between Batman and 'The Demon'. After freeing Talia from her father's clutches and escaping from an avalanche, Batman and Robin follow the only clue they have – the word 'Orpheus'. After discovering that 'Orpheus' is Ra's private satellite that will orbit over the Sahara, the duo travel to the Demon's desert stronghold. There, Batman learns that the satellite is actually a weapon which will explosively destroy all the Lazarus Pits simultaneously throughout the world, destroying all the life that exists. When a Batman impersonator appears in Gotham City, the real Batman deduces that Karl Rossum is somehow involved and confronts the inventor. The other Batman, a duplicate, then shows up and a battle between the two takes place. After the duplicate Batman escapes, it begins its campaign to recreate H.A.R.D.A.C.'s goals of a robotic society. Believing himself to be the reincarnation of Zeus, Maxie Zeus steals an experimental weapon that the government developed. The mad man desires to use the weapon against the people of Gotham City and Batman must put a stop to Maxie's mad plan against the city he loves. A brand-new gang has made its debut committing the slickest crimes ever, thanks to the gang leader, Scarface. It's up to Batman to stop Scarface and his \\\"dummy\\\", the Ventriloquist. Wealthy socialite Veronica Vreeland returns from Central America, bringing tiny handmade dolls for all her friends. According to native legend, once placed under a pillow, the dolls do the sleeper's worrying for them. Unknown to Veronica or her guests, each of the dolls was made by the Mad Hatter, and contains a tiny microchip which plantshypnotic suggestions inside the sleepers' brains. A mysterious bat-like creature terrorizes Gotham City, causing the police force to pursue Batman. The Dark Knight must find the real perpetrator to clear his name. Batman encounters the Scarecrow and attempts to foil his scheme to burn down Gotham University, but in the process is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear gas, and is forced to face his own guilt over the death of his parents. The Joker covers Gotham City in a cloud of laughing gas and begins plundering the crazed city. But after Alfred is infected with the toxin, Batman has added incentive to stop the Joker and acquire an antidote from him before all of Gotham dies with a smile. A botched police operation results in the suspension of those involved: Officer Wilkes, Officer Montoya, and Detective Bullock. Confronted by their superiors, each of them is forced to tell their tale of what happened that night. Mayor Hamilton Hill's miserable son, Jordan, becomes even sadder when his father uses his birthday party as a political gathering, and ends up stowing away in the truck of the party clown hired by Hill for the party, whom he doesn't know is actually the Joker in disguise. It is now up to Batman, whom Mayor Hill distrusts, to rescue the boy before it is too late. While Bruce is in Europe on a Wayne Enterprises business trip, the theft of a jade cat statue occurs at Gotham State University. Barbara Gordon again becomes Batgirl to investigate, only to run into Catwoman, who is also investigating, pointing out that the acid residue used to destroy the security system is not her style. The two team up to find the statue, with Robin tailing them, and things go from bad to worse when Roland Daggett is revealed to be involved. Using microchips stolen from the Mad Hatter, the Joker brainwashes famous comedians into committing crazy crimes in order to ruin their reputations. As it turns out, the comedians are the judges who tossed the Joker out of the Gotham Comedy Competition the year before. Now, the Clown Prince of Crime wants to seek his revenge, and Batman and Robin must foil the Joker's plot. Three wealthy, bored friends of Bruce Wayne decide to seek new thrills by becoming master criminals. As the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture (masters of land, sea and air), the Terrible Trio pick Gotham clean, until they encounter one person who cannot be bought off — Batman. The Riddler is hired to work for a toy company, vowing to turn over a new leaf. But Batman refuses to believe he has changed, and he suspects that the Riddler is still obsessed with outsmarting and defeating him. Now, the Dark Knight must prove that Riddler is still a criminal at heart and send him back to Arkham. The Red Claw organization kidnaps Alfred, seeking a code they need to arm a weapon of mass destruction that Alfred knows from his days as a British secret agent. The Joker steals an atomic bomb, and it is up to Batman and Robin to find and stop him. Since there is no time to spare, the duo enlist the help of Harley Quinn to track Joker down. Throughout the episode, it is briefly discussed how Harley met Joker. The Clock King returns to continue his vendetta against Mayor Hill. This time, the time-obsessed criminal hopes to murder Hill with the help of a stolen invention that allows him to warp time and travel at super-speed. Securing another device from its creator, Batman and Robin take on the Clock King in a furious high-speed battle for the mayor's life. Someone has put a hit out on Gotham's toughest cop, Harvey Bullock. After surviving several near misses, Bullock realizes he has no choice but to ask his arch-rival Batman to help him discover who is behind the murder attempts. During their investigation, Bullock learns that his gruff and mean-spirited manner has created enemies in the unlikeliest of people. Note: This episode won the 1996 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction and Composition. The episode was also adapted from a Chuck Dixon story that was published in Detective Comics #651. Ra's al Ghul narrates a story from his past in which Jonah Hex stops his plan to destroy the transcontinental railroad being completed in 1883, by using a war blimp. Not only has Poison Ivy been released from Arkham Asylum, but she's also married to her doctor and settled down to help him raise his two sons. It would appear that Ivy has gone straight and that her old days as a criminal are over. But wealthy bachelors are being struck down by an unknown toxin, leaving Batman to question Ivy's innocence. Mr. Freeze is kidnapped from his prison cell by aging billionaire Grant Walker. Walker is looking to freeze the world and recreate it according to his own design. Batman and Robin infiltrate the billionaire's underwater city and combat both high-tech robots and Mr. Freeze himself, who has personal reasons to do Walker's bidding and cover the Earth in a new ice age. Note: Walker's plot to freeze the world with a giant cannon was later used in Batman & Robin, where Mr. Freeze uses advanced technology to turn an observatory telescope into a freezing cannon to freeze a part of Gotham City and hold the city to ransom. Also, one of Karl Rossum's toy robots seen in this episode is an obvious tribute to the character \\\"Bat-Mite\\\". Lyle Bolton, the new head of security at Arkham, is fired for his atrocious mistreatment of the inmates. Six months later, Bolton becomes the vigilante Lock-Up, and decides to put who he feels responsible for the ruin of the city behind bars. It's up to Batman and Robin to save his victims. Just before he is to undergo the operation that will restore his sanity, Harvey Dent is kidnapped by a mysterious villain. Batman and Robin split up to nab the criminal behind the scheme to abduct the Dark Knight's old friend. They suspect that either the Penguin or Rupert Thorne may be behind the kidnapping. But is it really the Penguin or Thorne behind the kidnapping? Or is it someone else with a grudge against Harvey? Harley Quinn is released back into society, proved to be sane. After a misunderstanding at a clothing store, however, a snowball of comedic chaos builds around her. Gotham's new DA, Janet Van Dorn, is out to capture Batman, but both she and him end up captured by a gang of criminals instead. They are soon put on a kangaroo trial by the Joker (the judge), Two-Face (the prosecutor), the Ventriloquist (the bailiff), Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, the Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, the Scarecrow, the Riddler, and other criminals. If the defense (Batman and the D.A.) can prove that Batman is not the cause for everyone's turn to crime, they will be set free. When the jury gives the verdict of 'not guilty', the villains have little intention of following through on their deal. Notes: Henry Polic II, the Scarecrow's voice actor, was recuperating from throat surgery during the episode's production, so his character has no dialogue in it. Also, Van Dorn mentions in this episode that Harley Quinn was once a doctor at Arkham before the Joker corrupted her mind; backstory which is later shown in The New Batman Adventures episode \\\"Mad Love\\\". En route to an upstate prison, Killer Croc escapes and leads Batman on a dangerous chase through the wilderness. After throwing Batman temporarily off his trail, the reptile-man takes refuge with a group of retired circus freaks, and convinces them to help him. When Batman arrives, Croc and the freaks band together to capture him. Batman comes face-to-face with his most powerful adversary yet, the chemically-enhanced assassin Bane. Originally hired by Rupert Thorne to kill Batman, Bane plans on taking control of Thorne's criminal empire once Batman is destroyed. It is a fight to the death with all of Gotham in the balance, as Batman takes on the man who has vowed to break the Bat. Anxious to take up her old ways as Catwoman, Selina Kyle joins forces with the Ventriloquist to humiliate socialite Veronica Vreeland. But the real victim is Catwoman herself, who has been secretly set up by Scarface to take the fall for another robbery. Batman has to intercede before the furious feline makes things worse by killing the double-talking Ventriloquist. A washed-up actress named Mary Dahl has become bitter and insane after falling into obscurity and suffering from a disorder that prevents her body from growing to adulthood, thus biologically cursed with literal eternal youth. She kidnaps her TV family, who all led much happier lives and more successful careers than her, and holds them prisoner on the abandoned soundstage of her old show While Robin works fast to free the actors from Baby-Doll's explosive death-trap, Batman pursues the tiny fiend through a deadly carnival funhouse. A mystic Egyptian scroll donated to the Gotham museum by Bruce Wayne is stolen by Ra's al Ghul, and Batman and Talia must join forces to prevent the power-mad Ra's from unlocking the scroll's secrets of life and death. Their quest takes them to a hidden temple deep beneath the Egyptian desert. There, the Dark Knight is forced into a terrifying battle with an ancient Egyptian sorceress.\"},{\"name\":\"bowie\",\"text\":\"Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop\\nScrews the

Me\\nReally You\\nAnd really Me\\nIt's so hard for us to really be\\nReally You\\nAnd really Me\\nYou'll lose me though I'm always\\nreally free\\\"\\nAnd the mountain moved its eyes\\nTo the world of realize\\nWhere the snow had saved a place\\nFor the Wild Eyed Boy\\nfrom Freecloud\\nAnd the village Dreadful cried\\nAs the rope began to rise\\nFor the smile stayed on the face\\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy\\nfrom Freecloud\\nAnd the women once proud\\nClutched the heart of the crowd\\nAs the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand\\nAnd the Magic in the stare\\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy said\\n\\\"Stop, Freecloud\\nThey won't think to cut me down\\\"\\nBut the cottages fell\\nLike a playing card hell\\nAnd the tears on the face\\nOf the Wise Boy\\nCame tumbling down\\nTo the rumbling ground\\nAnd the missionary mystic of peace/love\\nStumbled to cry among the clouds\\nKicking back the pebbles\\nFrom the Freecloud mountain\\nTrack.\\n\\nI was walking through the counters of a national concern\\nAnd a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder\\nAnd I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean\\nAs the merchandise exchanged and money roared\\nAnd a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak\\nInto the paper bag at her side\\nAnd her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed\\nSo she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind\\nCrying\\n\\\"God knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod may look the other way today\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod may look the other way today\\\"\\nThen she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag\\nPerspiration trickled down her forehead\\nAnd her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder\\nShe was led away bewildered and amazed\\nThrough her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter\\nAs her escort asked her softly\\nfor her name\\nAnd a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady\\nWho had fainted to the whirling\\nwooden floor\\nCrying\\n\\\"God knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nSurely God won't look\\nthe other way\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nGod knows I'm good\\nSurely God won't look\\nthe other way\\\"\\n\\nThe Children of the summer's end\\nGathered in the dampened grass\\nWe played Our songs and felt the London sky\\nResting on our hands\\nIt was God's land\\nIt was ragged and naive\\nIt was Heaven\\nTouch, We touched the very soul\\nOf holding each and every life\\nWe claimed the very source of joy ran through\\nIt didn't, but it seemed that way\\nI kissed a lot of people that day\\nOh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon\\nTo paint that love\\nupon a white balloon\\nAnd fly it from\\nthe topest top of all the tops\\nThat man has pushed beyond his brain\\nSatori must be something\\njust the same\\nWe scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size\\nWe talked with tall Venusians passing through\\nAnd Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head\\nAnd away they soared\\nClimbing through\\nthe ivory vibrant cloud\\nSomeone passed some bliss among the crowd\\nAnd We walked back to the road, unchained\\n\\\"The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party.\\\"\\n\\nIn the corner of the morning in the past\\nI would sit and blame the master first and last\\nAll the roads were straight and narrow\\nAnd the prayers were small and yellow\\nAnd the rumour spread that I was aging fast\\nThen I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.\\nAnd I looked and frowned and the monster was me\\nWell, I said hello and I said hello\\nAnd I asked \\\"Why not?\\\" and I replied \\\"I don't know\\\"\\nSo we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be\\nAnd he laughed insane and quipped \\\"KAHLIL GIBRAN\\\"\\nSo I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through\\nFor I realized that God's a young man too\\nSo I said \\\"So long\\\" and I waved \\\"Bye-bye\\\"\\nAnd I smashed my soul and traded my mind\\nGot laid by a young bordello\\nI was vaguely half asleep\\nFor which my reputation swept back home in drag\\nAnd the moral of this magic spell\\nNegotiates my hide\\nWhen God did take my logic for a ride\\n(Riding along)\\nHe swallowed his pride and puckered his lips\\nAnd showed me the leather belt round his hips\\nMy knees were shaking my cheeks aflame\\nHe said \\\"You'll never go down to the Gods again\\\"\\n(Turn around,go back!)\\nHe struck the ground a cavern appeared\\nAnd I smelt the burning pit of fear\\nWe crashed a thousand yards below\\nI said \\\"Do it again, do it again\\\"\\n(Turn around,go back!)\\nHis nebulous body swayed above\\nHis tongue swollen with devil's love\\nThe snake and I, a venom high\\nI said \\\"Do it again, do it again\\\"\\n(Turn around, go back!)\\nBreathe, breathe, breathe deeply\\nAnd I was seething, breathing deeply\\nSpitting sentry, horned and tailed\\nWaiting for you\\n\\nDay after day\\nThey send my

blow\\nTo the far side of town\\nWhere it's pointless to be high\\n'Cause it's such a long way down\\nSo I tell them that\\nI can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm\\nI will do me harm\\nHere I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall\\nI'm not quite right at all...am I?\\nDon't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be\\nJust my librium and me\\nAnd my E.S.T. makes three\\n'Cause I'd rather stay here\\nWith all the madmen\\nThan perish with the sadmen roaming free\\nAnd I'd rather play here\\nWith all the madmen\\nFor I'm quite content they're all as sane as me\\n(Where can the horizon lie\\nWhen a nation hides\\nIts organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim\\nThey must be very dim)\\nDay after day\\nThey take some brain away\\nThen turn my face around\\nTo the far side of

spoke into his eyes\\nI thought you died alone, a long long time ago\\nOh no, not me\\nI never lost control\\nYou're face to face\\nWith The Man Who Sold The World\\nI laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home\\nI searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed\\nI gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here\\nWe must have died alone, a long long time ago\\nWho knows? not me\\nWe never lost control\\nYou're face to face\\nWith the Man who Sold the World\\n\\nWhen all the world was very young\\nAnd mountain magic heavy hung\\nThe supermen would walk in file\\nGuardians

then\\nNo death for the perfect men\\nLife rolls into one for them\\nSo softly a supergod cries\\nWhere all were minds in uni-thought\\nPower weird by mystics taught\\nNo pain, no joy, no power too great\\nColossal strength to grasp a fate\\nWhere sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers\\nNightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold\\nA man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die\\nTo turn to

in the pasture,\\nOr rhododendron worn.\\n\\nShe doth not wait for June;\\nBefore the world is green\\nHer sturdy little countenance\\nAgainst the wind is seen,\\n\\nContending with the grass,\\nNear kinsman to herself,\\nFor privilege of sod and sun,\\nSweet litigants for life.\\n\\nAnd when the hills are full,\\nAnd newer fashions blow,\\nDoth not retract a single spice\\nFor pang of jealousy.\\n\\nHer public is the noon,\\nHer providence the sun,\\nHer progress by the bee proclaimed\\nIn sovereign, swerveless tune.\\n\\nThe bravest of the host,\\nSurrendering the last,\\nNor even of defeat aware\\nWhen cancelled by the frost.\\n\\n\\nTHE BEE.\\n\\nLike trains of cars on tracks of plush\\nI hear the level bee:\\nA jar across the flowers goes,\\nTheir velvet masonry\\n\\nWithstands until the sweet assault\\nTheir chivalry consumes,\\nWhile he, victorious, tilts away\\nTo vanquish other blooms.\\n\\nHis feet are shod with gauze,\\nHis helmet is of gold;\\nHis breast, a single onyx\\nWith chrysoprase, inlaid.\\n\\nHis labor is a chant,\\nHis idleness a tune;\\nOh, for a bee's experience\\nOf clovers and of noon!\\n\\n\\nPresentiment is that long shadow on the lawn\\nIndicative that suns go down;\\nThe notice to the startled grass\\nThat darkness is about to pass.\\n\\n\\nAs children bid the guest good-night,\\nAnd then reluctant turn,\\nMy flowers raise their pretty lips,\\nThen put their nightgowns on.\\n\\nAs children caper when they wake,\\nMerry that it is morn,\\nMy flowers from a hundred cribs\\nWill peep, and prance again.\\n\\n\\nAngels in the early morning\\nMay be seen the dews among,\\nStooping, plucking, smiling, flying:\\nDo the buds to them belong?\\n\\nAngels when the sun is hottest\\nMay be seen the sands among,\\nStooping, plucking, sighing, flying;\\nParched the flowers they bear along.\\n\\n\\nSo bashful when I spied her,\\nSo pretty, so ashamed!\\nSo hidden in her leaflets,\\nLest anybody find;\\n\\nSo breathless till I passed her,\\nSo helpless when I turned\\nAnd bore her, struggling, blushing,\\nHer simple haunts beyond!\\n\\nFor whom I robbed the dingle,\\nFor whom betrayed the dell,\\nMany will doubtless ask me,\\nBut I shall never tell!\\n\\n\\nTWO WORLDS.\\n\\nIt makes no difference abroad,\\nThe seasons fit the same,\\nThe mornings blossom into noons,\\nAnd split their pods of flame.\\n\\nWild-flowers kindle in the woods,\\nThe brooks brag all the day;\\nNo blackbird bates his jargoning\\nFor passing Calvary.\\n\\nAuto-da-fe and judgment\\nAre nothing to the bee;\\nHis separation from his rose\\nTo him seems misery.\\n\\n\\nTHE MOUNTAIN.\\n\\nThe mountain sat upon the plain\\nIn his eternal chair,\\nHis observation omnifold,\\nHis inquest everywhere.\\n\\nThe seasons prayed around his knees,\\nLike children round a sire:\\nGrandfather of the days is he,\\nOf dawn the ancestor.\\n\\n\\nA DAY.\\n\\nI'll tell you how the sun rose, —\\nA ribbon at a time.\\nThe steeples swam in amethyst,\\nThe news like squirrels ran.\\n\\nThe hills untied their bonnets,\\nThe bobolinks begun.\\nThen I said softly to myself,\\n\\\"That must have been the sun!\\\"\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBut how he set, I know not.\\nThere seemed a purple stile\\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\\nWere climbing all the while\\n\\nTill when they reached the other side,\\nA dominie in gray\\nPut gently up the evening bars,\\nAnd led the flock away.\\n\\n\\nThe butterfly's assumption-gown,\\nIn chrysoprase apartments hung,\\nThis afternoon put on.\\n\\nHow condescending to descend,\\nAnd be of buttercups the friend\\nIn a New England town!\\n\\n\\nTHE WIND.\\n\\nOf all the sounds despatched abroad,\\nThere's not a charge to me\\nLike that old measure in the boughs,\\nThat phraseless melody\\n\\nThe wind does, working like a hand\\nWhose fingers brush the sky,\\nThen quiver down, with tufts of tune\\nPermitted gods and me.\\n\\nWhen winds go round and round in bands,\\nAnd thrum upon the door,\\nAnd birds take places overhead,\\nTo bear them orchestra,\\n\\nI crave him grace, of summer boughs,\\nIf such an outcast be,\\nHe never heard that fleshless chant\\nRise solemn in the tree,\\n\\nAs if some caravan of sound\\nOn deserts, in the sky,\\nHad broken rank,\\nThen knit, and passed\\nIn seamless company.\\n\\n\\nDEATH AND LIFE.\\n\\nApparently with no surprise\\nTo any happy flower,\\nThe frost beheads it at its play\\nIn accidental power.\\nThe blond assassin passes on,\\nThe sun proceeds unmoved\\nTo measure off another day\\nFor an approving God.\\n\\n\\n'T was later when the summer went\\nThan when the cricket came,\\nAnd yet we knew that gentle clock\\nMeant nought but going home.\\n\\n'T was sooner when the cricket went\\nThan when the winter came,\\nYet that pathetic pendulum\\nKeeps esoteric time.\\n\\n\\nINDIAN SUMMER.\\n\\nThese are the days when birds come back,\\nA very few, a bird or two,\\nTo take a backward look.\\n\\nThese are the days when skies put on\\nThe old, old sophistries of June, —\\nA blue and gold mistake.\\n\\nOh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,\\nAlmost thy plausibility\\nInduces my belief,\\n\\nTill ranks of seeds their witness bear,\\nAnd softly through the altered air\\nHurries a timid leaf!\\n\\nOh, sacrament of summer days,\\nOh, last communion in the haze,\\nPermit a child to join,\\n\\nThy sacred emblems to partake,\\nThy consecrated bread to break,\\nTaste thine immortal wine!\\n\\n\\nAUTUMN.\\n\\nThe morns are meeker than they were,\\nThe nuts are getting brown;\\nThe berry's cheek is plumper,\\nThe rose is out of town.\\n\\nThe maple wears a gayer scarf,\\nThe field a scarlet gown.\\nLest I should be old-fashioned,\\nI'll put a trinket on.\\n\\n\\nBECLOUDED.\\n\\nThe sky is low, the clouds are mean,\\nA travelling flake of snow\\nAcross a barn or through a rut\\nDebates if it will go.\\n\\nA narrow wind complains all

HIGGINSON\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt \\nappreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That \\\"irresistible needle-touch,\\\" as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties. \\nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her \\nfriend \\\"H.H.\\\" must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:— \\nMY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \\\"day and generation\\\" that you will not give them light.\\n\\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called \\\"dead\\\" you will be \\nwilling that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . . \\nTruly yours,\\n\\nHELEN JACKSON.\\n\\nThe \\\"portfolios\\\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of \\nnote-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse. \\nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first \\nstrong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture. \\nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, \\\"I made no verse, but \\none or two, until this winter.\\\"\\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more \\nabrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy. \\nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but \\\"A Country Burial,\\\" \\\"A Thunder-Storm,\\\" \\\"The Humming-Bird,\\\" and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the \\nend,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend. \\nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all \\ninterference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes. \\nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic \\nfitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the \\\"thought-rhyme\\\" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing. \\nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the \\nunknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God \\\"an Emersonian self-possession,\\\" it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare. \\nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming \\nof a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence. \\nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. \\nThe coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through \\\"the altered air,\\\" an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence. \\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD.\\n\\nAMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\\n\\nAugust, 1891.\\n\\nMy nosegays are for captives;\\nDim, long-expectant eyes,\\nFingers denied the plucking,\\nPatient till paradise,\\n\\nTo such, if they should whisper\\nOf morning and the moor,\\nThey bear no other errand,\\nAnd I, no other prayer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI. LIFE.\\n\\n\\nI'm nobody! Who are you?\\nAre you nobody, too?\\nThen there 's a pair of us — don't tell!\\nThey 'd banish us, you know.\\n\\nHow dreary to be somebody!\\nHow public, like a frog\\nTo tell your name the livelong day\\nTo an admiring bog!\\n\\n\\nI bring an unaccustomed wine\\nTo lips long parching, next to mine,\\nAnd summon them to drink.\\n\\nCrackling with fever, they essay;\\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\\nAnd come next hour to look.\\n\\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass;\\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas!\\nAre so superfluous cold,\\n\\nI would as soon attempt to warm\\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\\nAges beneath the mould.\\n\\nSome other thirsty there may be\\nTo whom this would have pointed me\\nHad it remained to speak.\\n\\nAnd so I always bear the cup\\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake, —\\n\\nIf, haply, any say to me,\\n\\\"Unto the little, unto me,\\\"\\nWhen I at last awake.\\n\\n\\nThe nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\\nThe heaven we chase\\nLike the June bee\\nBefore the school-boy\\nInvites the race;\\nStoops to an easy clover —\\nDips — evades — teases — deploys;\\nThen to the royal clouds\\nLifts his light pinnace\\nHeedless of the boy\\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\\n\\nHomesick for steadfast honey,\\nAh! the bee flies not\\nThat brews that rare variety.\\n\\n\\nWe play at paste,\\nTill qualified for pearl,\\nThen drop the paste,\\nAnd deem ourself a fool.\\nThe shapes, though, were similar,\\nAnd our new hands\\nLearned gem-tactics\\nPractising sands.\\n\\n\\nI found the phrase to every thought\\nI ever had, but one;\\nAnd that defies me, — as a hand\\nDid try to chalk the sun\\n\\nTo races nurtured in the dark; —\\nHow would your own begin?\\nCan blaze be done in cochineal,\\nOr noon in mazarin?\\n\\n\\nHOPE.\\n\\nHope is the thing with feathers\\nThat perches in the soul,\\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\\nAnd never stops at all,\\n\\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\\nAnd sore must be the storm\\nThat could abash the little bird\\nThat kept so many warm.\\n\\nI 've heard it in the chillest land,\\nAnd on the strangest sea;\\nYet, never, in extremity,\\nIt asked a crumb of me.\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE HEAT.\\n\\nDare you see a soul at the white heat?\\nThen crouch within the door.\\nRed is the fire's common tint;\\nBut when the vivid ore\\n\\nHas sated flame's conditions,\\nIts quivering substance plays\\nWithout a color but the light\\nOf unanointed blaze.\\n\\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\\nWhose anvil's even din\\nStands symbol for the finer forge\\nThat soundless tugs within,\\n\\nRefining these impatient ores\\nWith hammer and with blaze,\\nUntil the designated light\\nRepudiate the

scar hast thou?\\nAngels, write \\\"Promoted\\\"\\nOn this soldier's brow!\\n\\n\\nTHE TEST.\\n\\nI can wade grief,\\nWhole pools of it, —\\nI 'm used to that.\\nBut the least push of joy\\nBreaks up my feet,\\nAnd I tip — drunken.\\nLet no pebble smile,\\n'T was the new liquor, —\\nThat was all!\\n\\nPower is only pain,\\nStranded, through discipline,\\nTill weights will hang.\\nGive balm to giants,\\nAnd they 'll wilt, like men.\\nGive Himmaleh, —\\nThey 'll carry him!\\n\\n\\nESCAPE.\\n\\nI never hear the word \\\"escape\\\"\\nWithout a quicker blood,\\nA sudden expectation,\\nA flying attitude.\\n\\nI never hear of prisons broad\\nBy soldiers battered down,\\nBut I tug childish at my bars, —\\nOnly to fail again!\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMPENSATION.\\n\\nFor each ecstatic instant\\nWe must an anguish pay\\nIn keen and quivering ratio\\nTo the ecstasy.\\n\\nFor each beloved hour\\nSharp pittances of years,\\nBitter contested farthings\\nAnd coffers heaped with tears.\\n\\n\\nTHE MARTYRS.\\n\\nThrough the straight pass of suffering\\nThe martyrs even trod,\\nTheir feet upon temptation,\\nTheir faces upon God.\\n\\nA stately, shriven company;\\nConvulsion playing round,\\nHarmless as streaks of meteor\\nUpon a planet's bound.\\n\\nTheir faith the everlasting troth;\\nTheir expectation fair;\\nThe needle to the north degree\\nWades so, through polar air.\\n\\n\\nA PRAYER.\\n\\nI meant to have but modest needs,\\nSuch as content, and heaven;\\nWithin my income these could lie,\\nAnd life and I keep even.\\n\\nBut since the last included both,\\nIt would suffice my prayer\\nBut just for one to stipulate,\\nAnd grace would grant the pair.\\n\\nAnd so, upon this wise I prayed, —\\nGreat Spirit, give to me\\nA heaven not so large as yours,\\nBut large enough for me.\\n\\nA smile suffused Jehovah's face;\\nThe cherubim withdrew;\\nGrave saints stole out to look at me,\\nAnd showed their dimples, too.\\n\\nI left the place with all my might, —\\nMy prayer away I threw;\\nThe quiet ages picked it up,\\nAnd Judgment twinkled, too,\\n\\nThat one so honest be extant\\nAs take the tale for true\\nThat \\\"Whatsoever you shall ask,\\nItself be given you.\\\"\\n\\nBut I, grown shrewder, scan the skies\\nWith a suspicious air, —\\nAs children, swindled for the first,\\nAll swindlers be, infer.\\n\\n\\nThe thought beneath so slight a film\\nIs more distinctly seen, —\\nAs laces just reveal the surge,\\nOr mists the Apennine.\\n\\n\\nThe soul unto itself\\nIs an imperial friend, —\\nOr the most agonizing spy\\nAn enemy could send.\\n\\nSecure against its own,\\nNo treason it can fear;\\nItself its sovereign, of itself\\nThe soul should stand in awe.\\n\\n\\nSurgeons must be very careful\\nWhen they take the knife!\\nUnderneath their fine incisions\\nStirs the culprit, — Life!\\n\\n\\nTHE RAILWAY TRAIN.\\n\\nI like to see it lap the miles,\\nAnd lick the valleys up,\\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\\nAnd then, prodigious, step\\n\\nAround a pile of mountains,\\nAnd, supercilious, peer\\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\\nAnd then a quarry pare\\n\\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\\nComplaining all the while\\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\\nThen chase itself down hill\\n\\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\\nThen, punctual as a star,\\nStop — docile and omnipotent —\\nAt its own stable door.\\n\\n\\nTHE SHOW.\\n\\nThe show is not the show,\\nBut they that go.\\nMenagerie to me\\nMy neighbor be.\\nFair play —\\nBoth went to see.\\n\\n\\nDelight becomes pictorial\\nWhen viewed through pain, —\\nMore fair, because impossible\\nThat any gain.\\n\\nThe mountain at a given distance\\nIn amber lies;\\nApproached, the amber flits a little, —\\nAnd that 's the skies!\\n\\n\\nA thought went up my mind to-day\\nThat I have had before,\\nBut did not finish, — some way back,\\nI could not fix the year,\\n\\nNor where it went, nor why it came\\nThe second time to me,\\nNor

by merchantman,\\nReport was not to me.\\n\\n\\nBY THE SEA.\\n\\nI started early, took my dog,\\nAnd visited the sea;\\nThe mermaids in the basement\\nCame out to look at me,\\n\\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\\nExtended hempen hands,\\nPresuming me to be a mouse\\nAground, upon the sands.\\n\\nBut no man moved me till the tide\\nWent past my simple shoe,\\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\\nAnd past my bodice too,\\n\\nAnd made as he would eat me up\\nAs wholly as a dew\\nUpon a dandelion's sleeve —\\nAnd then I started too.\\n\\nAnd he — he followed close behind;\\nI felt his silver heel\\nUpon my ankle, — then my shoes\\nWould overflow with pearl.\\n\\nUntil we met the solid town,\\nNo man he seemed to know;\\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\\n\\n\\nOLD-FASHIONED.\\n\\nArcturus is his other name, —\\nI'd rather call him star!\\nIt's so unkind of science\\nTo go and interfere!\\n\\nI pull a flower from the woods, —\\nA monster with a glass\\nComputes the stamens in a breath,\\nAnd has her in a class.\\n\\nWhereas I took the butterfly\\nAforetime in my hat,\\nHe sits erect in cabinets,\\nThe clover-bells forgot.\\n\\nWhat once was heaven, is zenith now.\\nWhere I proposed to go\\nWhen time's brief masquerade was done,\\nIs mapped, and charted too!\\n\\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\\nAnd stand upon their heads!\\nI hope I 'm ready for the worst,\\nWhatever prank betides!\\n\\nPerhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!\\nI hope the children there\\nWon't be new-fashioned when I come,\\nAnd laugh at me, and stare!\\n\\nI hope the father in the skies\\nWill lift his little girl, —\\nOld-fashioned, naughty, everything, —\\nOver the stile of pearl!\\n\\n\\nA TEMPEST.\\n\\nAn awful tempest mashed the air,\\nThe clouds were gaunt and few;\\nA black, as of a spectre's cloak,\\nHid heaven and earth from view.\\n\\nThe creatures chuckled on the roofs\\nAnd whistled in the air,\\nAnd shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.\\nAnd swung their frenzied hair.\\n\\nThe morning lit, the birds arose;\\nThe monster's faded eyes\\nTurned slowly to his native coast,\\nAnd peace was Paradise!\\n\\n\\nTHE SEA.\\n\\nAn everywhere of silver,\\nWith ropes of sand\\nTo keep it from effacing\\nThe track called land.\\n\\n\\nIN THE GARDEN.\\n\\nA bird came down the walk:\\nHe did not know I saw;\\nHe bit an angle-worm in halves\\nAnd ate the fellow, raw.\\n\\nAnd then he drank a dew\\nFrom a convenient grass,\\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the wall\\nTo let a beetle pass.\\n\\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\\nThat hurried all abroad, —\\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought;\\nHe stirred his velvet head\\n\\nLike one in danger; cautious,\\nI offered him a crumb,\\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\\nAnd rowed him softer home\\n\\nThan oars divide the ocean,\\nToo silver for a seam,\\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\\nLeap, plashless, as they swim.\\n\\n\\nTHE SNAKE.\\n\\nA narrow fellow in the grass\\nOccasionally rides;\\nYou may have met him, — did you not,\\nHis notice sudden is.\\n\\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\\nA spotted shaft is seen;\\nAnd then it closes at your feet\\nAnd opens further on.\\n\\nHe likes a boggy acre,\\nA floor too cool for corn.\\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\\nI more than once, at morn,\\n\\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\\nUnbraiding in the sun, —\\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\\n\\nSeveral of nature's people\\nI know, and they know me;\\nI feel for them a transport\\nOf cordiality;\\n\\nBut never met this fellow,\\nAttended or alone,\\nWithout a tighter breathing,\\nAnd zero at the bone.\\n\\n\\nTHE MUSHROOM.\\n\\nThe mushroom is the elf of plants,\\nAt evening it is not;\\nAt morning in a truffled hut\\nIt stops upon a spot\\n\\nAs if it tarried always;\\nAnd yet its whole career\\nIs shorter than a snake's delay,\\nAnd fleeter than a tare.\\n\\n'T is vegetation's juggler,\\nThe germ of alibi;\\nDoth like a bubble antedate,\\nAnd like a bubble hie.\\n\\nI feel as if the grass were pleased\\nTo have it intermit;\\nThe surreptitious scion\\nOf summer's circumspect.\\n\\nHad nature any outcast face,\\nCould she a son contemn,\\nHad nature an Iscariot,\\nThat mushroom, — it is him.\\n\\n\\nTHE STORM.\\n\\nThere came a wind like a bugle;\\nIt quivered through the grass,\\nAnd a green chill upon the heat\\nSo ominous did pass\\nWe barred the windows and the doors\\nAs from an emerald ghost;\\nThe doom's electric moccason\\nThat very instant passed.\\nOn a strange mob of panting trees,\\nAnd fences fled away,\\nAnd rivers where the houses ran\\nThe living looked that day.\\nThe bell within the steeple wild\\nThe flying tidings whirled.\\nHow much can come\\nAnd much can go,\\nAnd yet abide the world!\\n\\n\\nTHE SPIDER.\\n\\nA spider sewed at night\\nWithout a light\\nUpon an arc of white.\\nIf ruff it was of dame\\nOr shroud of gnome,\\nHimself, himself inform.\\nOf immortality\\nHis strategy\\nWas physiognomy.\\n\\n\\nI know a place where summer strives\\nWith such a practised frost,\\nShe each year leads her daisies back,\\nRecording briefly, \\\"Lost.\\\"\\n\\nBut when the south wind stirs the pools\\nAnd struggles in the lanes,\\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\\nAnd she pours soft refrains\\n\\nInto the lap of adamant,\\nAnd spices, and the dew,\\nThat stiffens quietly to quartz,\\nUpon her amber shoe.\\n\\n\\nThe one that could repeat the summer day\\nWere greater than itself, though he\\nMinutest of mankind might be.\\nAnd who could reproduce the sun,\\nAt period of going down —\\nThe lingering and the stain, I mean —\\nWhen Orient has been outgrown,\\nAnd Occident becomes unknown,\\nHis name remain.\\n\\n\\nTHE WlND'S VISIT.\\n\\nThe wind tapped like a tired man,\\nAnd like a host, \\\"Come in,\\\"\\nI boldly answered; entered then\\nMy residence within\\n\\nA rapid, footless guest,\\nTo offer whom a chair\\nWere as impossible as hand\\nA sofa to the air.\\n\\nNo bone had he to bind him,\\nHis speech was like the push\\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\\nFrom a superior bush.\\n\\nHis countenance a billow,\\nHis fingers, if he pass,\\nLet go a music, as of tunes\\nBlown tremulous in glass.\\n\\nHe visited, still flitting;\\nThen, like a timid man,\\nAgain he tapped — 't was flurriedly —\\nAnd I became alone.\\n\\n\\nNature rarer uses yellow\\nThan another hue;\\nSaves she all of that for sunsets, —\\nProdigal of blue,\\n\\nSpending scarlet like a woman,\\nYellow she affords\\nOnly scantly and selectly,\\nLike a lover's words.\\n\\n\\nGOSSIP.\\n\\nThe leaves, like women, interchange\\nSagacious confidence;\\nSomewhat of nods, and somewhat of\\nPortentous inference,\\n\\nThe parties in both cases\\nEnjoining secrecy, —\\nInviolable compact\\nTo notoriety.\\n\\n\\nSIMPLICITY.\\n\\nHow happy is the little stone\\nThat rambles in the road alone,\\nAnd doesn't care about careers,\\nAnd exigencies never fears;\\nWhose coat of elemental brown\\nA passing universe put on;\\nAnd independent as the sun,\\nAssociates or glows alone,\\nFulfilling absolute decree\\nIn casual simplicity.\\n\\n\\nSTORM.\\n\\nIt sounded as if the streets were running,\\nAnd then the streets stood still.\\nEclipse was all we could see at the window,\\nAnd awe was all we could feel.\\n\\nBy and by the boldest stole out of his covert,\\nTo see if time was there.\\nNature was in her beryl apron,\\nMixing fresher air.\\n\\n\\nTHE RAT.\\n\\nThe rat is the concisest tenant.\\nHe pays no rent, —\\nRepudiates the obligation,\\nOn schemes intent.\\n\\nBalking our wit\\nTo sound or circumvent,\\nHate cannot harm\\nA foe so reticent.\\n\\nNeither decree\\nProhibits him,\\nLawful as\\nEquilibrium.\\n\\n\\nFrequently the woods are pink,\\nFrequently are brown;\\nFrequently the hills undress\\nBehind my native town.\\n\\nOft a head is crested\\nI was wont to see,\\nAnd as oft a cranny\\nWhere it used to be.\\n\\nAnd the earth, they tell me,\\nOn its axis turned, —\\nWonderful rotation\\nBy but twelve performed!\\n\\n\\nA THUNDER-STORM.\\n\\nThe wind begun to rock the grass\\nWith threatening tunes and low, —\\nHe flung a menace at the earth,\\nA menace at the sky.\\n\\nThe leaves unhooked themselves from trees\\nAnd started all abroad;\\nThe dust did scoop itself like hands\\nAnd throw away the road.\\n\\nThe wagons quickened on the streets,\\nThe thunder hurried slow;\\nThe lightning showed a yellow beak,\\nAnd then a livid claw.\\n\\nThe birds put up the bars to nests,\\nThe cattle fled to barns;\\nThere came one drop of giant rain,\\nAnd then, as if the hands\\n\\nThat held the dams had parted hold,\\nThe waters wrecked the sky,\\nBut overlooked my father's house,\\nJust quartering a tree.\\n\\n\\nWITH FLOWERS.\\n\\nSouth winds jostle them,\\nBumblebees come,\\nHover, hesitate,\\nDrink, and are gone.\\n\\nButterflies pause\\nOn their passage Cashmere;\\nI, softly plucking,\\nPresent them here!\\n\\n\\nSUNSET.\\n\\nWhere ships of purple gently toss\\nOn seas of daffodil,\\nFantastic sailors mingle,\\nAnd then — the wharf is still.\\n\\n\\nShe sweeps with many-colored brooms,\\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\\nCome back, and dust the pond!\\n\\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\\nYou dropped an amber thread;\\nAnd now you 've littered all the East\\nWith duds of emerald!\\n\\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\\nAnd still the aprons fly,\\nTill brooms fade softly into stars —\\nAnd then I come away.\\n\\n\\nLike mighty footlights burned the red\\nAt bases of the trees, —\\nThe far theatricals of day\\nExhibiting to these.\\n\\n'T was universe that did applaud\\nWhile, chiefest of the crowd,\\nEnabled by his royal dress,\\nMyself distinguished God.\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS.\\n\\nBring me the sunset in a cup,\\nReckon the morning's flagons up,\\nAnd say how many dew;\\nTell me how far the morning leaps,\\nTell me what time the weaver sleeps\\nWho spun the breadths of blue!\\n\\nWrite me how many notes there be\\nIn the new robin's ecstasy\\nAmong astonished boughs;\\nHow many trips the tortoise makes,\\nHow many cups the bee partakes, —\\nThe debauchee of dews!\\n\\nAlso, who laid the rainbow's piers,\\nAlso, who leads the docile spheres\\nBy withes of supple blue?\\nWhose fingers string the stalactite,\\nWho counts the wampum of the night,\\nTo see that none is due?\\n\\nWho built this little Alban house\\nAnd shut the windows down so close\\nMy spirit cannot see?\\nWho 'll let me out some gala day,\\nWith implements to fly away,\\nPassing pomposity?\\n\\n\\nTHE JUGGLER OF DAY.\\n\\nBlazing in gold and quenching in purple,\\nLeaping like leopards to the sky,\\nThen at the feet of the old horizon\\nLaying her spotted face, to die;\\n\\nStooping as low as the otter's window,\\nTouching the roof and tinting the barn,\\nKissing her bonnet to the meadow, —\\nAnd the juggler of day is gone!\\n\\n\\nMY CRICKET.\\n\\nFarther in summer than the birds,\\nPathetic from the grass,\\nA minor nation celebrates\\nIts unobtrusive mass.\\n\\nNo ordinance is seen,\\nSo gradual the grace,\\nA pensive custom it becomes,\\nEnlarging loneliness.\\n\\nAntiquest felt at noon\\nWhen August, burning low,\\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\\nRepose to typify.\\n\\nRemit as yet no grace,\\nNo furrow on the glow,\\nYet a druidic difference\\nEnhances nature now.\\n\\n\\nAs imperceptibly as grief\\nThe summer lapsed away, —\\nToo imperceptible, at last,\\nTo seem like perfidy.\\n\\nA quietness distilled,\\nAs twilight long begun,\\nOr Nature, spending with herself\\nSequestered afternoon.\\n\\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\\nThe morning foreign shone, —\\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\\nAs guest who would be gone.\\n\\nAnd thus, without a wing,\\nOr service of a keel,\\nOur summer made her light escape\\nInto the beautiful.\\n\\n\\nIt can't be summer, — that got through;\\nIt 's early yet for spring;\\nThere 's that long town of white to cross\\nBefore the blackbirds sing.\\n\\nIt can't be dying, — it's too rouge, —\\nThe dead shall go in white.\\nSo sunset shuts my question down\\nWith clasps of chrysolite.\\n\\n\\nSUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.\\n\\nThe gentian weaves her fringes,\\nThe maple's loom is red.\\nMy departing blossoms\\nObviate parade.\\n\\nA brief, but patient illness,\\nAn hour to prepare;\\nAnd one, below this morning,\\nIs where the angels are.\\n\\nIt was a short procession, —\\nThe bobolink was there,\\nAn aged bee addressed us,\\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\\n\\nWe trust that she was willing, —\\nWe ask that we may be.\\nSummer, sister, seraph,\\nLet us go with thee!\\n\\nIn the name of the bee\\nAnd of the butterfly\\nAnd of the breeze, amen!\\n\\n\\nFRINGED GENTIAN.\\n\\nGod made a little gentian;\\nIt tried to be a rose\\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\\nBut just before the snows\\nThere came a purple creature\\nThat ravished all the hill;\\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\\nAnd mockery was still.\\nThe frosts were her condition;\\nThe Tyrian would not come\\nUntil the North evoked it.\\n\\\"Creator! shall I bloom?\\\"\\n\\n\\nNOVEMBER.\\n\\nBesides the autumn poets sing,\\nA few prosaic days\\nA little this side of the snow\\nAnd that side of the haze.\\n\\nA few incisive mornings,\\nA few ascetic eyes, —\\nGone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,\\nAnd Mr. Thomson's sheaves.\\n\\nStill is the bustle in the brook,\\nSealed are the spicy valves;\\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\\nThe eyes of many elves.\\n\\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain,\\nMy sentiments to share.\\nGrant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,\\nThy windy will to bear!\\n\\n\\nTHE SNOW.\\n\\nIt sifts from leaden sieves,\\nIt powders all the wood,\\nIt fills with alabaster wool\\nThe wrinkles of the road.\\n\\nIt makes an even face\\nOf mountain and of plain, —\\nUnbroken forehead from the east\\nUnto the east again.\\n\\nIt reaches to the fence,\\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\\nIt flings a crystal veil\\n\\nOn stump and stack and stem, —\\nThe summer's empty room,\\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\\nRecordless, but for them.\\n\\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\\nAs ankles of a queen, —\\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\\nDenying they have been.\\n\\n\\nTHE BLUE JAY.\\n\\nNo brigadier throughout the year\\nSo civic as the jay.\\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\\nWith shrill felicity\\n\\nPursuing winds that censure us\\nA February day,\\nThe brother of the universe\\nWas never blown away.\\n\\nThe snow and he are intimate;\\nI 've often seen them play\\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\\nWith such severity,\\n\\nI felt apology were due\\nTo an insulted sky,\\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\\nTo their temerity.\\n\\nThe pillow of this daring head\\nIs pungent evergreens;\\nHis larder — terse and militant —\\nUnknown, refreshing things;\\n\\nHis character a tonic,\\nHis future a dispute;\\nUnfair an immortality\\nThat leaves this neighbor out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\\n\\n\\nLet down the bars, O Death!\\nThe tired flocks come in\\nWhose bleating ceases to repeat,\\nWhose wandering is done.\\n\\nThine is the stillest night,\\nThine the securest fold;\\nToo near thou art for seeking thee,\\nToo tender to be told.\\n\\n\\nGoing to heaven!\\nI don't know when,\\nPray do not ask me how, —\\nIndeed, I 'm too astonished\\nTo think of answering you!\\nGoing to heaven! —\\nHow dim it sounds!\\nAnd yet it will be done\\nAs sure as flocks go home at night\\nUnto the shepherd's arm!\\n\\nPerhaps you 're going too!\\nWho knows?\\nIf you should get there first,\\nSave just a little place for me\\nClose to the two I lost!\\n\\nThe smallest \\\"robe\\\" will fit me,\\nAnd just a bit of \\\"crown;\\\"\\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\\nWhen we are going home.\\n\\nI 'm glad I don't believe it,\\nFor it would stop my breath,\\nAnd I 'd like to look a little more\\nAt such a curious earth!\\nI am glad they did believe it\\nWhom I have never found\\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\\nI left them in the ground.\\n\\n\\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\\nO Jesus! in the air\\nI know not which thy chamber is, —\\nI 'm knocking everywhere.\\n\\nThou stirrest earthquake in the South,\\nAnd maelstrom in the sea;\\nSay, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\\nHast thou no arm for me?\\n\\n\\nEPITAPH.\\n\\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\\nThe broadest land that grows\\nIs not so ample as the breast\\nThese emerald seams enclose.\\n\\nStep lofty; for this name is told\\nAs far as cannon dwell,\\nOr flag subsist, or fame export\\nHer deathless syllable.\\n\\n\\nMorns like these we parted;\\nNoons like these she rose,\\nFluttering first, then firmer,\\nTo her fair repose.\\n\\nNever did she lisp it,\\nAnd 't was not for me;\\nShe was mute from transport,\\nI, from agony!\\n\\nTill the evening, nearing,\\nOne the shutters drew —\\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\\nAnd this linnet flew!\\n\\n\\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\\nWho, had they lived, had died, but when\\nThey died, vitality begun.\\n\\n\\nI read my sentence steadily,\\nReviewed it with my eyes,\\nTo see that I made no mistake\\nIn its extremest clause, —\\n\\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\\nAnd then the pious form\\nThat \\\"God have mercy\\\" on the soul\\nThe jury voted him.\\n\\nI made my soul familiar\\nWith her extremity,\\nThat at the last it should not be\\nA novel agony,\\n\\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\\nSalute and pass without a hint —\\nAnd there the matter ends.\\n\\n\\nI have not told my garden yet,\\nLest that should conquer me;\\nI have not quite the strength now\\nTo break it to the bee.\\n\\nI will not name it in the street,\\nFor shops would stare, that I,\\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\\nShould have the face to die.\\n\\nThe hillsides must not know it,\\nWhere I have rambled so,\\nNor tell the loving forests\\nThe day that I shall go,\\n\\nNor lisp it at the table,\\nNor heedless by the way\\nHint that within the riddle\\nOne will walk to-day!\\n\\n\\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.\\n\\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\\nLike petals from a rose,\\nWhen suddenly across the June\\nA wind with fingers goes.\\n\\nThey perished in the seamless grass, —\\nNo eye could find the place;\\nBut God on his repealless list\\nCan summon every face.\\n\\n\\nThe only ghost I ever saw\\nWas dressed in mechlin, — so;\\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\\nBut rapid, like the roe;\\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\\n\\nHis conversation seldom,\\nHis laughter like the breeze\\nThat dies away in dimples\\nAmong the pensive trees.\\nOur interview was transient,—\\nOf me, himself was shy;\\nAnd God forbid I look behind\\nSince that appalling day!\\n\\n\\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, —\\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\\nBefore their feet are cold.\\n\\nNever the treasures in her nest\\nThe cautious grave exposes,\\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\\n\\nThis covert have all the children\\nEarly aged, and often cold, —\\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\\n\\n\\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\\nBecome so wondrous dear,\\nAs for the lost we grapple,\\nThough all the rest are here, —\\n\\nIn broken mathematics\\nWe estimate our prize,\\nVast, in its fading ratio,\\nTo our penurious eyes!\\n\\n\\nMEMORIALS.\\n\\nDeath sets a thing significant\\nThe eye had hurried by,\\nExcept a perished creature\\nEntreat us tenderly\\n\\nTo ponder little workmanships\\nIn crayon or in wool,\\nWith \\\"This was last her fingers did,\\\"\\nIndustrious until\\n\\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\\nAnd then 't was put among the dust\\nUpon the closet shelves.\\n\\nA book I have, a friend gave,\\nWhose pencil, here and there,\\nHad notched the place that pleased him, —\\nAt rest his fingers are.\\n\\nNow, when I read, I read not,\\nFor interrupting tears\\nObliterate the etchings\\nToo costly for repairs.\\n\\n\\nI went to heaven, —\\n'T was a small town,\\nLit with a ruby,\\nLathed with down.\\nStiller than the fields\\nAt the full dew,\\nBeautiful as pictures\\nNo man drew.\\nPeople like the moth,\\nOf mechlin, frames,\\nDuties of gossamer,\\nAnd eider names.\\nAlmost contented\\nI could be\\n'Mong such unique\\nSociety.\\n\\n\\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\\nTheir glory nought to me;\\n'T was best imperfect, as it was;\\nI 'm finite, I can't see.\\n\\nThe house of supposition,\\nThe glimmering frontier\\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\\nTo me shows insecure.\\n\\nThe wealth I had contented me;\\nIf 't was a meaner size,\\nThen I had counted it until\\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\\n\\nBetter than larger values,\\nHowever true their show;\\nThis timid life of evidence\\nKeeps pleading, \\\"I don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThere is a shame of nobleness\\nConfronting sudden pelf, —\\nA finer shame of ecstasy\\nConvicted of itself.\\n\\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\\nAcknowledged of the brave, —\\nOne more \\\"Ye Blessed\\\" to be told;\\nBut this involves the grave.\\n\\n\\nTRIUMPH.\\n\\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\\nThere 's triumph in the room\\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\\nBy faith is overcome.\\n\\nThere 's triumph of the finer mind\\nWhen truth, affronted long,\\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\\nHer God her only throng.\\n\\nA triumph when temptation's bribe\\nIs slowly handed back,\\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\\nAnd one upon the rack.\\n\\nSeverer triumph, by himself\\nExperienced, who can pass\\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\\nJehovah's countenance!\\n\\n\\nPompless no life can pass away;\\nThe lowliest career\\nTo the same pageant wends its way\\nAs that exalted here.\\nHow cordial is the mystery!\\nThe hospitable pall\\nA \\\"this way\\\" beckons spaciously, —\\nA miracle for all!\\n\\n\\nI noticed people disappeared,\\nWhen but a little child, —\\nSupposed they visited remote,\\nOr settled regions wild.\\n\\nNow know I they both visited\\nAnd settled regions wild,\\nBut did because they died, — a fact\\nWithheld the little child!\\n\\n\\nFOLLOWING.\\n\\nI had no cause to be awake,\\nMy best was gone to sleep,\\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\\nAnd failed to wake them up,\\n\\nBut called the others clear,\\nAnd passed their curtains by.\\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\\nKnock, recollect, for me!\\n\\nI looked at sunrise once,\\nAnd then I looked at them,\\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\\nFor circumstance the same.\\n\\n'T was such an ample peace,\\nIt could not hold a sigh, —\\n'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\\n'T was sunset all the day.\\n\\nSo choosing but a gown\\nAnd taking but a prayer,\\nThe only raiment I should need,\\nI struggled, and was there.\\n\\n\\nIf anybody's friend be dead,\\nIt 's sharpest of the theme\\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\\nAt such and such a time.\\n\\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\\nSome manner of the hair, —\\nA prank nobody knew but them,\\nLost, in the sepulchre.\\n\\nHow warm they were on such a day:\\nYou almost feel the date,\\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\\nThey 're centuries from that.\\n\\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\\nYou try to touch the smile,\\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\\nWhen was it, can you tell,\\n\\nYou asked the company to tea,\\nAcquaintance, just a few,\\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\\nThat don't remember you?\\n\\nPast bows and invitations,\\nPast interview, and vow,\\nPast what ourselves can estimate, —\\nThat makes the quick of woe!\\n\\n\\nTHE JOURNEY.\\n\\nOur journey had advanced;\\nOur feet were almost come\\nTo that odd fork in Being's road,\\nEternity by term.\\n\\nOur pace took sudden awe,\\nOur feet reluctant led.\\nBefore were cities, but between,\\nThe forest of the dead.\\n\\nRetreat was out of hope, —\\nBehind, a sealed route,\\nEternity's white flag before,\\nAnd God at every gate.\\n\\n\\nA COUNTRY BURIAL.\\n\\nAmple make this bed.\\nMake this bed with awe;\\nIn it wait till judgment break\\nExcellent and fair.\\n\\nBe its mattress straight,\\nBe its pillow round;\\nLet no sunrise' yellow noise\\nInterrupt this ground.\\n\\n\\nGOING.\\n\\nOn such a night, or such a night,\\nWould anybody care\\nIf such a little figure\\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\\n\\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\\nThat nobody might know\\nBut that the little figure\\nRocked softer, to and fro?\\n\\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\\nWould anybody sigh\\nThat such a little figure\\nToo sound asleep did lie\\n\\nFor chanticleer to wake it, —\\nOr stirring house below,\\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\\nOr early task to do?\\n\\nThere was a little figure plump\\nFor every little knoll,\\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\\nAnd trudging feet from school.\\n\\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\\nAnd visions vast and small.\\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\\nShould reach so small a goal!\\n\\n\\nEssential oils are wrung:\\nThe attar from the rose\\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\\nIt is the gift of screws.\\n\\nThe general rose decays;\\nBut this, in lady's drawer,\\nMakes summer when the lady lies\\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\\n\\n\\nI lived on dread; to those who know\\nThe stimulus there is\\nIn danger, other impetus\\nIs numb and vital-less.\\n\\nAs 't were a spur upon the soul,\\nA fear will urge it where\\nTo go without the spectre's aid\\nWere challenging despair.\\n\\n\\nIf I should die,\\nAnd you should live,\\nAnd time should gurgle on,\\nAnd morn should beam,\\nAnd noon should burn,\\nAs it has usual done;\\nIf birds should build as early,\\nAnd bees as bustling go, —\\nOne might depart at option\\nFrom enterprise below!\\n'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\\nWhen we with daisies lie,\\nThat commerce will continue,\\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\\nIt makes the parting tranquil\\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\\nConduct the pleasing scene!\\n\\n\\nAT LENGTH.\\n\\nHer final summer was it,\\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\\nIf tenderer industriousness\\nPervaded her, we thought\\n\\nA further force of life\\nDeveloped from within, —\\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\\nAnd made the hurry plain.\\n\\nWe wondered at our blindness, —\\nWhen nothing was to see\\nBut her Carrara guide-post, —\\nAt our stupidity,\\n\\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\\nThe busy darling lay,\\nSo busy was she, finishing,\\nSo leisurely were we!\\n\\n\\nGHOSTS.\\n\\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\\nOne need not be a house;\\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\\nMaterial place.\\n\\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\\nExternal ghost,\\nThan an interior confronting\\nThat whiter host.\\n\\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\\nThe stones achase,\\nThan, moonless, one's own self encounter\\nIn lonesome place.\\n\\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\\nShould startle most;\\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\\nBe horror's least.\\n\\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\\nHe bolts the door,\\nO'erlooking a superior spectre\\nMore near.\\n\\n\\nVANISHED.\\n\\nShe died, — this was the way she died;\\nAnd when her breath was done,\\nTook up her simple wardrobe\\nAnd started for the sun.\\n\\nHer little figure at the gate\\nThe angels must have spied,\\nSince I could never find her\\nUpon the mortal side.\\n\\n\\nPRECEDENCE.\\n\\nWait till the majesty of Death\\nInvests so mean a brow!\\nAlmost a powdered footman\\nMight dare to touch it now!\\n\\nWait till in everlasting robes\\nThis democrat is dressed,\\nThen prate about \\\"preferment\\\"\\nAnd \\\"station\\\" and the rest!\\n\\nAround this quiet courtier\\nObsequious angels wait!\\nFull royal is his retinue,\\nFull purple is his state!\\n\\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\\nTo such a modest clay,\\nSince that my Lord, \\\"the Lord of lords\\\"\\nReceives unblushingly!\\n\\n\\nGONE.\\n\\nWent up a year this evening!\\nI recollect it well!\\nAmid no bells nor bravos\\nThe bystanders will tell!\\nCheerful, as to the village,\\nTranquil, as to repose,\\nChastened, as to the chapel,\\nThis humble tourist rose.\\nDid not talk of returning,\\nAlluded to no time\\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\\nWe might look for him;\\nWas grateful for the roses\\nIn life's diverse bouquet,\\nTalked softly of new species\\nTo pick another day.\\n\\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\\nHands bustled at the moorings —\\nThe crowd respectful grew.\\nAscended from our vision\\nTo countenances new!\\nA difference, a daisy,\\nIs all the rest I knew!\\n\\n\\nREQUIEM.\\n\\nTaken from men this morning,\\nCarried by men to-day,\\nMet by the gods with banners\\nWho marshalled her away.\\n\\nOne little maid from playmates,\\nOne little mind from school, —\\nThere must be guests in Eden;\\nAll the rooms are full.\\n\\nFar as the east from even,\\nDim as the border star, —\\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\\nOur departed are.\\n\\n\\nWhat inn is this\\nWhere for the night\\nPeculiar traveller comes?\\nWho is the landlord?\\nWhere the maids?\\nBehold, what curious rooms!\\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\\nNo brimming tankards flow.\\nNecromancer, landlord,\\nWho are these below?\\n\\n\\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\\nAnd all the dead lie down;\\nIt was not night, for all the bells\\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\\n\\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\\nI felt siroccos crawl, —\\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\\nCould keep a chancel cool.\\n\\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\\nThe figures I have seen\\nSet orderly, for burial,\\nReminded me of mine,\\n\\nAs if my life were shaven\\nAnd fitted to a frame,\\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\\nAnd 't was like midnight, some,\\n\\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\\nAnd space stares, all around,\\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\\nRepeal the beating ground.\\n\\nBut most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —\\nWithout a chance or spar,\\nOr even a report of land\\nTo justify despair.\\n\\n\\nTILL THE END.\\n\\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\\nBecause — because if he should die\\nWhile I was gone, and I — too late —\\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\\n\\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\\nAnd could not bear to shut until\\nThey \\\"noticed\\\" me — they noticed me;\\n\\nIf I should stab the patient faith\\nSo sure I 'd come — so sure I 'd come,\\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\\nTelling my tardy name, —\\n\\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\\nWere useless as next morning's sun,\\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\\n\\n\\nVOID.\\n\\nGreat streets of silence led away\\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\\nNo universe, no laws.\\n\\nBy clocks 't was morning, and for night\\nThe bells at distance called;\\nBut epoch had no basis here,\\nFor period exhaled.\\n\\n\\nA throe upon the features\\nA hurry in the breath,\\nAn ecstasy of parting\\nDenominated \\\"Death,\\\" —\\n\\nAn anguish at the mention,\\nWhich, when to patience grown,\\nI 've known permission given\\nTo rejoin its own.\\n\\n\\nSAVED!\\n\\nOf tribulation these are they\\nDenoted by the white;\\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\\nOf victors designate.\\n\\nAll these did conquer; but the ones\\nWho overcame most times\\nWear nothing commoner than snow,\\nNo ornament but palms.\\n\\nSurrender is a sort unknown\\nOn this superior soil;\\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\\nRemembered as the mile\\n\\nOur panting ankle barely gained\\nWhen night devoured the road;\\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\\nAnd all we said was \\\"Saved\\\"!\\n\\n\\nI think just how my shape will rise\\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\\n\\nI think just how my lips will weigh\\nWith shapeless, quivering prayer\\nThat you, so late, consider me,\\nThe sparrow of your care.\\n\\nI mind me that of anguish sent,\\nSome drifts were moved away\\nBefore my simple bosom broke, —\\nAnd why not this, if they?\\n\\nAnd so, until delirious borne\\nI con that thing, — \\\"forgiven,\\\" —\\nTill with long fright and longer trust\\nI drop my heart, unshriven!\\n\\n\\nTHE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.\\n\\nAfter a hundred years\\nNobody knows the place, —\\nAgony, that enacted there,\\nMotionless as peace.\\n\\nWeeds triumphant ranged,\\nStrangers strolled and spelled\\nAt the lone orthography\\nOf the elder dead.\\n\\nWinds of summer fields\\nRecollect the way, —\\nInstinct picking up the key\\nDropped by memory.\\n\\n\\nLay this laurel on the one\\nToo intrinsic for renown.\\nLaurel! veil your deathless tree, —\\nHim you chasten, that is he!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOEMS\\n\\nby EMILY DICKINSON\\n\\nThird Series\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdited by\\n\\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's all I have to bring to-day,\\nThis, and my heart beside,\\nThis, and my heart, and all the fields,\\nAnd all the meadows wide.\\nBe sure you count, should I forget, —\\nSome one the sum could tell, —\\nThis, and my heart, and all the bees\\nWhich in the clover dwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nI. LIFE.\\n\\n\\nREAL RICHES.\\n\\n'T is little I could care for pearls\\nWho own the ample sea;\\nOr brooches, when the Emperor\\nWith rubies pelteth me;\\n\\nOr gold, who am the Prince of Mines;\\nOr diamonds, when I see\\nA diadem to fit a dome\\nContinual crowning me.\\n\\n\\nSUPERIORITY TO FATE.\\n\\nSuperiority to fate\\nIs difficult to learn.\\n'T is not conferred by any,\\nBut possible to earn\\n\\nA pittance at a time,\\nUntil, to her surprise,\\nThe soul with strict economy\\nSubsists till Paradise.\\n\\n\\nHOPE.\\n\\nHope is a subtle glutton;\\nHe feeds upon the fair;\\nAnd yet, inspected closely,\\nWhat abstinence is there!\\n\\nHis is the halcyon table\\nThat never seats but one,\\nAnd whatsoever is consumed\\nThe same amounts remain.\\n\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRU\\n\\nForbidden fruit a flavor has\\nThat lawful orchards mocks;\\nHow luscious lies the pea within\\nThe pod that Duty locks!\\n\\n\\nFORBIDDEN FRU\\n\\nHeaven is what I cannot reach!\\nThe apple on the tree,\\nProvided it do hopeless hang,\\nThat 'heaven' is, to me.\\n\\nThe color on the cruising cloud,\\nThe interdicted ground\\nBehind the hill, the house behind, —\\nThere Paradise is found!\\n\\n\\nA WORD.\\n\\nA word is dead\\nWhen it is said,\\nSome say.\\nI say it just\\nBegins to live\\nThat day.\\n\\n\\nTo venerate the simple days\\nWhich lead the seasons by,\\nNeeds but to remember\\nThat from you or me\\nThey may take the trifle\\nTermed mortality!\\n\\nTo invest existence with a stately air,\\nNeeds but to remember\\nThat the acorn there\\nIs the egg of forests\\nFor the upper air!\\n\\n\\nLIFE'S TRADES.\\n\\nIt's such a little thing to weep,\\nSo short a thing to sigh;\\nAnd yet by trades the size of these\\nWe men and women die!\\n\\n\\nDrowning is not so pitiful\\nAs the attempt to rise.\\nThree times, 't is said, a sinking man\\nComes up to face the skies,\\nAnd then declines forever\\nTo that abhorred abode\\nWhere hope and he part company, —\\nFor he is grasped of God.\\nThe Maker's cordial visage,\\nHowever good to see,\\nIs shunned, we must admit it,\\nLike an adversity.\\n\\n\\nHow still the bells in steeples stand,\\nTill, swollen with the sky,\\nThey leap upon their silver feet\\nIn frantic melody!\\n\\n\\nIf the foolish call them 'flowers,'\\nNeed the wiser tell?\\nIf the savans 'classify' them,\\nIt is just as well!\\n\\nThose who read the Revelations\\nMust not criticise\\nThose who read the same edition\\nWith beclouded eyes!\\n\\nCould we stand with that old Moses\\nCanaan denied, —\\nScan, like him, the stately landscape\\nOn the other side, —\\n\\nDoubtless we should deem superfluous\\nMany sciences\\nNot pursued by learnèd angels\\nIn scholastic skies!\\n\\nLow amid that glad Belles lettres\\nGrant that we may stand,\\nStars, amid profound Galaxies,\\nAt that grand 'Right hand'!\\n\\n\\nA SYLLABLE.\\n\\nCould mortal lip divine\\nThe undeveloped freight\\nOf a delivered syllable,\\n'T would crumble with the weight.\\n\\n\\nPARTING.\\n\\nMy life closed twice before its close;\\nIt yet remains to see\\nIf Immortality unveil\\nA third event to me,\\n\\nSo huge, so hopeless to conceive,\\nAs these that twice befell.\\nParting is all we know of heaven,\\nAnd all we need of hell.\\n\\n\\nASPIRATION.\\n\\nWe never know how high we are\\nTill we are called to rise;\\nAnd then, if we are true to plan,\\nOur statures touch the skies.\\n\\nThe heroism we recite\\nWould be a daily thing,\\nDid not ourselves the cubits warp\\nFor fear to be a king.\\n\\n\\nTHE INEVITABLE.\\n\\nWhile I was fearing it, it came,\\nBut came with less of fear,\\nBecause that fearing it so long\\nHad almost made it dear.\\nThere is a fitting a dismay,\\nA fitting a despair.\\n'Tis harder knowing it is due,\\nThan knowing it is here.\\nThe trying on the utmost,\\nThe morning it is new,\\nIs terribler than wearing it\\nA whole existence through.\\n\\n\\nA BOOK.\\n\\nThere is no frigate like a book\\nTo take us lands away,\\nNor any coursers like a page\\nOf prancing poetry.\\nThis traverse may the poorest take\\nWithout oppress of toll;\\nHow frugal is the chariot\\nThat bears a human soul!\\n\\n\\nWho has not found the heaven below\\nWill fail of it above.\\nGod's residence is next to mine,\\nHis furniture is love.\\n\\n\\nA PORTRAIT.\\n\\nA face devoid of love or grace,\\nA hateful, hard, successful face,\\nA face with which a stone\\nWould feel as thoroughly at ease\\nAs were they old acquaintances, —\\nFirst time together thrown.\\n\\n\\nI HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.\\n\\nI had a guinea golden;\\nI lost it in the sand,\\nAnd though the sum was simple,\\nAnd pounds were in the land,\\nStill had it such a value\\nUnto my frugal eye,\\nThat when I could not find it\\nI sat me down to sigh.\\n\\nI had a crimson robin\\nWho sang full many a day,\\nBut when the woods were painted\\nHe, too, did fly away.\\nTime brought me other robins, —\\nTheir ballads were the same, —\\nStill for my missing troubadour\\nI kept the 'house at hame.'\\n\\nI had a star in heaven;\\nOne Pleiad was its name,\\nAnd when I was not heeding\\nIt wandered from the same.\\nAnd though the skies are crowded,\\nAnd all the night ashine,\\nI do not care about it,\\nSince none of them are mine.\\n\\nMy story has a moral:\\nI have a missing friend, —\\nPleiad its name, and robin,\\nAnd guinea in the sand, —\\nAnd when this mournful ditty,\\nAccompanied with tear,\\nShall meet the eye of traitor\\nIn country far from here,\\nGrant that repentance solemn\\nMay seize upon his mind,\\nAnd he no consolation\\nBeneath the sun may find.\\n\\nNOTE. — This poem may have had, like many others, a\\npersonal origin. It is more than probable that it was\\nsent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty\\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies.\\n\\n\\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON.\\n\\nFrom all the jails the boys and girls\\nEcstatically leap, —\\nBeloved, only afternoon\\nThat prison doesn't keep.\\n\\nThey storm the earth and stun the air,\\nA mob of solid bliss.\\nAlas! that frowns could lie in wait\\nFor such a foe as this!\\n\\n\\n\\nFew get enough, — enough is one;\\nTo that ethereal throng\\nHave not each one of us the right\\nTo stealthily belong?\\n\\n\\nUpon the gallows hung a wretch,\\nToo sullied for the hell\\nTo which the law entitled him.\\nAs nature's curtain fell\\nThe one who bore him tottered in,\\nFor this was woman's son.\\n''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;\\nOh, what a livid boon!\\n\\n\\nTHE LOST THOUGHT.\\n\\nI felt a clearing in my mind\\nAs if my brain had split;\\nI tried to match it, seam by seam,\\nBut could not make them fit.\\n\\nThe thought behind I strove to join\\nUnto the thought before,\\nBut sequence ravelled out of reach\\nLike balls upon a floor.\\n\\n\\nRETICENCE.\\n\\nThe reticent volcano keeps\\nHis never slumbering plan;\\nConfided are his projects pink\\nTo no precarious man.\\n\\nIf nature will not tell the tale\\nJehovah told to her,\\nCan human nature not survive\\nWithout a listener?\\n\\nAdmonished by her buckled lips\\nLet every babbler be.\\nThe only secret people keep\\nIs Immortality.\\n\\n\\nWITH FLOWERS.\\n\\nIf recollecting were forgetting,\\nThen I remember not;\\nAnd if forgetting, recollecting,\\nHow near I had forgot!\\nAnd if to miss were merry,\\nAnd if to mourn were gay,\\nHow very blithe the fingers\\nThat gathered these to-day!\\n\\n\\nThe farthest thunder that I heard\\nWas nearer than the sky,\\nAnd rumbles still, though torrid noons\\nHave lain their missiles by.\\nThe lightning that preceded it\\nStruck no one but myself,\\nBut I would not exchange the bolt\\nFor all the rest of life.\\nIndebtedness to oxygen\\nThe chemist may repay,\\nBut not the obligation\\nTo electricity.\\nIt founds the homes and decks the days,\\nAnd every clamor bright\\nIs but the gleam concomitant\\nOf that waylaying light.\\nThe thought is quiet as a flake, —\\nA crash without a sound;\\nHow life's reverberation\\nIts explanation found!\\n\\n\\nOn the bleakness of my lot\\nBloom I strove to raise.\\nLate, my acre of a rock\\nYielded grape and maize.\\n\\nSoil of flint if steadfast tilled\\nWill reward the hand;\\nSeed of palm by Lybian sun\\nFructified in sand.\\n\\n\\nCONTRAST.\\n\\nA door just opened on a street —\\nI, lost, was passing by —\\nAn instant's width of warmth disclosed,\\nAnd wealth, and company.\\n\\nThe door as sudden shut, and I,\\nI, lost, was passing by, —\\nLost doubly, but by contrast most,\\nEnlightening misery.\\n\\n\\n\\nFRIENDS.\\n\\nAre friends delight or pain?\\nCould bounty but remain\\nRiches were good.\\n\\nBut if they only stay\\nBolder to fly away,\\nRiches are sad.\\n\\n\\n\\nFIRE.\\n\\nAshes denote that fire was;\\nRespect the grayest pile\\nFor the departed creature's sake\\nThat hovered there awhile.\\n\\nFire exists the first in light,\\nAnd then consolidates, —\\nOnly the chemist can disclose\\nInto what carbonates.\\n\\n\\nA MAN.\\n\\nFate slew him, but he did not drop;\\nShe felled — he did not fall —\\nImpaled him on her fiercest stakes —\\nHe neutralized them all.\\n\\nShe stung him, sapped his firm advance,\\nBut, when her worst was done,\\nAnd he, unmoved, regarded her,\\nAcknowledged him a man.\\n\\n\\nVENTURES.\\n\\nFinite to fail, but infinite to venture.\\nFor the one ship that struts the shore\\nMany's the gallant, overwhelmed creature\\nNodding in navies nevermore.\\n\\n\\nGRIEFS.\\n\\nI measure every grief I meet\\nWith analytic eyes;\\nI wonder if it weighs like mine,\\nOr has an easier size.\\n\\nI wonder if they bore it long,\\nOr did it just begin?\\nI could not tell the date of mine,\\nIt feels so old a pain.\\n\\nI wonder if it hurts to live,\\nAnd if they have to try,\\nAnd whether, could they choose between,\\nThey would not rather die.\\n\\nI wonder if when years have piled —\\nSome thousands — on the cause\\nOf early hurt, if such a lapse\\nCould give them any pause;\\n\\nOr would they go on aching still\\nThrough centuries above,\\nEnlightened to a larger pain\\nBy contrast with the love.\\n\\nThe grieved are many, I am told;\\nThe reason deeper lies, —\\nDeath is but one and comes but once,\\nAnd only nails the eyes.\\n\\nThere's grief of want, and grief of cold, —\\nA sort they call 'despair;'\\nThere's banishment from native eyes,\\nIn sight of native air.\\n\\nAnd though I may not guess the kind\\nCorrectly, yet to me\\nA piercing comfort it affords\\nIn passing Calvary,\\n\\nTo note the fashions of the cross,\\nOf those that stand alone,\\nStill fascinated to presume\\nThat some are like my own.\\n\\n\\nI have a king who does not speak;\\nSo, wondering, thro' the hours meek\\nI trudge the day away,—\\nHalf glad when it is night and sleep,\\nIf, haply, thro' a dream to peep\\nIn parlors shut by day.\\n\\nAnd if I do, when morning comes,\\nIt is as if a hundred drums\\nDid round my pillow roll,\\nAnd shouts fill all my childish sky,\\nAnd bells keep saying 'victory'\\nFrom steeples in my soul!\\n\\nAnd if I don't, the little Bird\\nWithin the Orchard is not heard,\\nAnd I omit to pray,\\n'Father, thy will be done' to-day,\\nFor my will goes the other way,\\nAnd it were perjury!\\n\\n\\nDISENCHANTMENT.\\n\\nIt dropped so low in my regard\\nI heard it hit the ground,\\nAnd go to pieces on the stones\\nAt bottom of my mind;\\n\\nYet blamed the fate that fractured, less\\nThan I reviled myself\\nFor entertaining plated wares\\nUpon my silver shelf.\\n\\n\\nLOST FAITH.\\n\\nTo lose one's faith surpasses\\nThe loss of an estate,\\nBecause estates can be\\nReplenished, — faith cannot.\\n\\nInherited with life,\\nBelief but once can be;\\nAnnihilate a single clause,\\nAnd Being's beggary.\\n\\n\\nLOST JOY.\\n\\nI had a daily bliss\\nI half indifferent viewed,\\nTill sudden I perceived it stir, —\\nIt grew as I pursued,\\n\\nTill when, around a crag,\\nIt wasted from my sight,\\nEnlarged beyond my utmost scope,\\nI learned its sweetness right.\\n\\n\\nI worked for chaff, and earning wheat\\nWas haughty and betrayed.\\nWhat right had fields to arbitrate\\nIn matters ratified?\\n\\nI tasted wheat, — and hated chaff,\\nAnd thanked the ample friend;\\nWisdom is more becoming viewed\\nAt distance than at hand.\\n\\n\\nLife, and Death, and Giants\\nSuch as these, are still.\\nMinor apparatus, hopper of the mill,\\nBeetle at the candle,\\nOr a fife's small fame,\\nMaintain by accident\\nThat they proclaim.\\n\\n\\nALPINE GLOW.\\n\\nOur lives are Swiss, —\\nSo still, so cool,\\nTill, some odd afternoon,\\nThe Alps neglect

That April!\\nLock the door!\\nI will not be pursued!\\nHe stayed away a year, to call\\nWhen I am occupied.\\nBut trifles look so trivial\\nAs soon as you have come,\\nThat blame is just as dear as praise\\nAnd praise as mere as blame.\\n\\n\\nMARCH.\\n\\nWe like March, his shoes are purple,\\nHe is new and high;\\nMakes he mud for dog and peddler,\\nMakes he forest dry;\\nKnows the adder's tongue his coming,\\nAnd begets her spot.\\nStands the sun so close and mighty\\nThat our minds are hot.\\nNews is he of all the others;\\nBold it were to die\\nWith the blue-birds buccaneering\\nOn his British sky.\\n\\n\\nDAWN.\\n\\nNot knowing when the dawn will come\\nI open every door;\\nOr has it feathers like a bird,\\nOr billows like a shore?\\n\\n\\nA murmur in the trees to note,\\nNot loud enough for wind;\\nA star not far enough to seek,\\nNor near enough to find;\\n\\nA long, long yellow on the lawn,\\nA hubbub as of feet;\\nNot audible, as ours to us,\\nBut dapperer, more sweet;\\n\\nA hurrying home of little men\\nTo houses unperceived, —\\nAll this, and more, if I should tell,\\nWould never be believed.\\n\\nOf robins in the trundle bed\\nHow many I espy\\nWhose nightgowns could not hide the wings,\\nAlthough I heard them try!\\n\\nBut then I promised ne'er to tell;\\nHow could I break my word?\\nSo go your way and I'll go mine, —\\nNo fear you'll miss the road.\\n\\n\\nMorning is the place for dew,\\nCorn is made at noon,\\nAfter dinner light for flowers,\\nDukes for setting sun!\\n\\n\\nTo my quick ear the leaves conferred;\\nThe bushes they were bells;\\nI could not find a privacy\\nFrom Nature's sentinels.\\n\\nIn cave if I presumed to hide,\\nThe walls began to tell;\\nCreation seemed a mighty crack\\nTo make me visible.\\n\\n\\nA ROSE.\\n\\nA sepal, petal, and a thorn\\nUpon a common summer's morn,\\nA flash of dew, a bee or two,\\nA breeze\\nA caper in the trees, —\\nAnd I'm a rose!\\n\\n\\nHigh from the earth I heard a bird;\\nHe trod upon the trees\\nAs he esteemed them trifles,\\nAnd then he spied a breeze,\\nAnd situated softly\\nUpon a pile of wind\\nWhich in a perturbation\\nNature had left behind.\\nA joyous-going fellow\\nI gathered from his talk,\\nWhich both of benediction\\nAnd badinage partook,\\nWithout apparent burden,\\nI learned, in leafy wood\\nHe was the faithful father\\nOf a dependent brood;\\nAnd this untoward transport\\nHis remedy for care, —\\nA contrast to our respites.\\nHow different we are!\\n\\n\\nCOBWEBS.\\n\\nThe spider as an artist\\nHas never been employed\\nThough his

well!\\nThe water lives so far,\\nLike neighbor from another world\\nResiding in a jar.\\n\\nThe grass does not appear afraid;\\nI often wonder he\\nCan stand so close and look so bold\\nAt what is dread to me.\\n\\nRelated somehow they may be, —\\nThe sedge stands next the sea,\\nWhere he is floorless, yet of fear\\nNo evidence gives he.\\n\\nBut nature is a stranger yet;\\nThe ones that cite her most\\nHave never passed her haunted house,\\nNor simplified her ghost.\\n\\nTo pity those that know her not\\nIs helped by the regret\\nThat those who know her, know her less\\nThe nearer her they get.\\n\\n\\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, —\\nOne clover, and a bee,\\nAnd revery.\\nThe revery alone will do\\nIf bees are few.\\n\\n\\nTHE WIND.\\n\\nIt's like the light, —\\nA fashionless delight\\nIt's like the bee, —\\nA dateless melody.\\n\\nIt's like the woods,\\nPrivate like breeze,\\nPhraseless, yet it stirs\\nThe proudest trees.\\n\\nIt's like the morning, —\\nBest when it's done, —\\nThe everlasting clocks\\nChime noon.\\n\\n\\nA dew sufficed itself\\nAnd satisfied a leaf,\\nAnd felt, 'how vast a destiny!\\nHow trivial is life!'\\n\\nThe sun went out to work,\\nThe day went out to play,\\nBut not again that dew was seen\\nBy physiognomy.\\n\\nWhether by day abducted,\\nOr emptied by the sun\\nInto the sea, in passing,\\nEternally unknown.\\n\\n\\nTHE WOODPECKER.\\n\\nHis bill an auger is,\\nHis head, a cap and frill.\\nHe laboreth at every tree, —\\nA worm his utmost goal.\\n\\n\\nA SNAKE.\\n\\nSweet is the swamp with its secrets,\\nUntil we meet a snake;\\n'T is then we sigh for houses,\\nAnd our departure take\\nAt that enthralling gallop\\nThat only childhood knows.\\nA snake is summer's treason,\\nAnd guile is where it goes.\\n\\n\\nCould I but ride indefinite,\\nAs doth the meadow-bee,\\nAnd visit only where I liked,\\nAnd no man visit me,\\n\\nAnd flirt all day with buttercups,\\nAnd marry whom I may,\\nAnd dwell a little everywhere,\\nOr better, run away\\n\\nWith no police to follow,\\nOr chase me if I do,\\nTill I should jump peninsulas\\nTo get away from you, —\\n\\nI said, but just to be a bee\\nUpon a raft of air,\\nAnd row in nowhere all day long,\\nAnd anchor off the bar,—\\nWhat liberty!
