Commissioner Gordon and the rest of the police arrive on the scene and watch as Batman leaps and swings away. After escaping Arkham Asylum on Christmas Eve, The Joker takes over Gotham's airwaves and terrorizes the city for a crime. He challenges Batman and Robin to find his hidden TV studio and free his hostages — Commissioner Gordon, Detective Bullock and Summer Gleason — before midnight. When District Attorney Harvey Dent collapses after a meal with his fiancée Pamela Isley and friend Bruce Wayne, doctors discover that he has been poisoned. Batman must find the culprit and the antidote before the DA's time runs out. Batman traces a series of bizarre robberies on the streets of Gotham back to a band of homeless children, who have been raised to do the bidding of their master, the Sewer King. While investigating the disappearances of Gotham's homeless in an undercover disguise, Bruce Wayne is kidnapped and imprisoned in a chain gang mining camp, suffering from amnesia. Alfred must thus track him down, help him escape, and free the rest of the prisoners. Mobster Rupert Thorne attempts to use Harvey Dent's secret split personality to blackmail him. But when Dent meets with Thorne at a chemical plant, \"Big Bad Harv\" takes over, and the resulting confrontation leads to an explosion that horribly scars half of Dent's face. Harvey Dent, now calling himself Two-Face, resurfaces and starts robbing Rupert Thorne's illegal businesses, preparing for a final confrontation with the crime boss, and Batman must stop his former friend before he and Thorne kill each other. During a fight with Batman over a stolen Fabergé egg, the Penguin incapacitates Batman with poison gas. The Dark Knight is rescued by a teenage amateur detective named Sherman Grant and his friend Roberta, who hide Batman in Sherman's basement long enough for him to recover before the Penguin finds them. Bitter scientist Victor Fries, as Mr. Freeze, attacks several divisions of GothCorp, each time stealing a piece for a secret weapon he intends to build. Batman investigates the connections, and discovers that the start of Freeze's vendetta against GothCorp was a bitter falling out between Fries and GothCorp's CEO, Ferris Boyle (Mark Hamill), during which Boyle almost killed Fries (mutating him into Freeze) and presumably killed Fries' terminally ill wife, Nora. Batman must find a way to bring Boyle to justice before Freeze carries out his revenge. Batman encounters a new cat burglar calling herself Catwoman, and around the same time, meets a woman named Selina Kyle (as Bruce Wayne), to whom he is visibly attracted. When Selina runs into trouble with a terrorist group known as The Red Claw, who want the mountain lion sanctuary she was trying to protect, she decides to take matters into her own hands and investigate. The leader of the Red Claw group (known herself only as Red Claw) attacks a military train and steals a viral plague, which she intends to release in Gotham if she isn't paid a ransom. Can Batman and Catwoman put aside their differences and work together to stop Red Claw before it is too late? Lloyd \"Eddie\" Ventrix is on the verge of losing his daughter, Kimberly, to his ex-wife, Helen, due to his past as a con artist. Determined not to lose Kimberly, Ventrix dons a suit, stolen from where he used to work while on parole, which grants the user invisibility but also becomes highly toxic, and poses as Kimberly's imaginary friend, Mojo, while stealing jewellery for her. Can Batman solve the mystery crimes and stop Ventrix, and at the same time, save his life, despite the fact that he cannot even see him? Simon Trent, an actor best known for his past role as \"The Gray Ghost\", is on the verge of bankruptcy thanks to his declining career. To save himself, he sells off all of his Gray Ghost merchandise. Immediately afterwards, a series of crimes related to the old show begin to occur. Batman, having himself been inspired partly by the show to become the crimefighter he now is, goes to Trent for help, and they team up to put an end to the crimes, and also revive Trent's career. Batman investigates a cult, called the Brotherhood, founded by the \"mystic\" Nostromos after hearing about a number of stories from his colleagues about his ability to predict the future. Batman finds out that Nostromos is actually a con artist who was rigging near-fatal accidents to gain the confidence of Gotham's upper class citizens. Can Batman expose this ruse before it's too late? Bruce Wayne is framed for the attempted murder of Lucius Fox. The real perpetrator is an actor and master of disguise named Matt Hagen, who was disfigured in a car accident years ago. In order to keep his fame, he secretly started working for Roland Daggett, who provides him with a monthly supply of an addictive face cream known as Renuyu (a pun on \"Renew You\") that can temporarily reshape his face back to normal, and who wants to take Wayne Enterprises over for marketing expansion. For botching the murder, Hagen's supply is cut off, and when he breaks into Daggett's lab for more Renuyu, he pays the price dearly when Daggett's men drench his face in the formula and force him to swallow liters of it to avoid drowning. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is arrested and taken into custody, charged with the assault on Fox. Bruce Wayne is released from prison on bail. Hagen, as it turns out, survived the murder attempt on him, but at a high cost: the formula entered his body and soaked every single one of his cells, turning him into a shape-shifting mutant. With his newfound powers, Hagen, now calling himself Clayface, decides to take his revenge on Daggett and his men. Can Batman bring Daggett to justice and stop Clayface before innocent people are hurt? After a man named Charlie Collins curses at the Joker on the road for bumping him, the Clown Prince of Crime corners him and intimidates him into doing him a \"small favor\". Two years pass, and the Joker finally decides how to use Charlie: to sneak a bomb into the Peregrinator's Club, where Commissioner Gordon is to give a speech at an award ceremony. Charlie, who merely has to open the door, is skeptical at first, but for the sake of his family, he reluctantly decides to obey. But is the Joker really the type to let someone who insulted him live? Detective Bullock is arrested for kidnapping. Batman, who dislikes Bullock but nevertheless believes him to be a good man, investigates, and discovers the identity of the real criminal: Killer Croc, who harbors a vendetta against Bullock for capturing him once. Can he clear Bullock's name before it is too late? The Scarecrow invents a fear chemical that is activated by adrenaline. Then, he uses it to affect the outcome of athletic events. Whenever a single person becomes agitated, the fear chemical kicks in, turning his excitement to fear. The Scarecrow bets against the sports stars' teams as part of his criminal scheme to scare up some quick cash, and Batman and Robin must foil his plot. After his company goes bankrupt, Temple Fugate becomes the Clock King. Fugate sets out to seek his revenge against the man whom he blames for his misfortunes: Mayor Hamilton Hill. Fugate kidnaps Hill, intending to do away with him to accomplish his revenge. Batman must stop Fugate from carrying out his revenge and save the mayor's life. With the help of arsonists, Roland Daggett plans to destroy Crime Alley and use the land to expand his business empire. But that plan would mean killing the residents or forcing them to abandon their homes. Now, Batman must foil Daggett's plan and try to prove that he is a criminal. Miserable Wayne Industries scientist Jervis Tetch is unable to pursue the girl he loves, Alice the secretary. When she splits up from her boyfriend, he makes an advance and develops a fast friendship with her, until her boyfriend reconciles with her and proposes to her. Enraged, Tetch decides to take matters into his own hands, and dons the mantle of the Mad Hatter, using his mind-control devices to force those who have wronged him all his life to become his mindless slaves. Batman is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum after being exposed to the Scarecrow's fear-inducing gas. Batman knows that the Scarecrow has escaped for the second time and is planning to poison Gotham's water supply with the same fear-inducing gas. Can Batman bring himself to break the law and escape from Arkham before the Scarecrow brings Gotham to its knees? Several rich industrialists are invited to the Eternal Youth Health Spa, and that's where they are last seen before disappearing. The only connection: they had something to do with the death of plants. Bruce Wayne also receives an invitation (although it was one of his greedy directors who nearly made the deal to destroy a rainforest before Bruce forced him to shut the operation down), but Alfred and his \"lady friend\", Maggie, go in his place. When they do not return, Batman is forced to investigate, discovering that the spa is run by Poison Ivy, and that she has been using a formula to turn the industrialists into humanoid trees, including Alfred and Maggie. Bruce Wayne wakes up one morning to find that his life is completely upside-down: his parents are alive, the Batcave does not exist, Alfred does not remember Robin, and he is engaged to Selina Kyle. However, it doesn't mean that Batman isn't still around, and Bruce starts to wonder what has happened, especially after seeing the characteristics of a dream (such as book and newspaper prints not making sense) inside this new life. Baron Jozek, furious at Batman for humiliating him at a dinner party (over Jozek's underworld connections), hires Josiah Wormwood, a master in setting traps for his victims, to hunt down Batman and bring back the hero's cape and cowl. During a fight with some gangsters at a construction yard, Batman and Robin learn the name of their boss: Billy Marin. While Robin looks forward to going up against Marin, Batman becomes distant, and after a falling out at the Batcave, Batman doesn't allow Robin to accompany him on the search for Marin. Robin investigates on the Batcomputer, and soon realizes that Billy Marin is not the boss' real name. Rather, it is an alias of Tony Zucco, the man who killed his parents (which Batman already knew, but chose not to tell Robin). Will Robin ever trust Batman again? Angered by Batman's deceit, Robin sets out to find Tony Zucco on his own, all the while plagued by the memories of his parents' death and how Bruce took him in as his own son. Eventually, Batman manages to find Zucco at an old amusement park, but breaks his leg during the fight. Robin finally arrives and prepares to kill Zucco in revenge. Can Batman prevent his partner from crossing the line between justice and revenge? Joker creates a toxin that affects only fish, mutating them into Joker fish. Then, he targets innocent men who refuse to copyright his Joker fish. The Joker also captures Harvey Bullock, and Batman must rescue him and foil the Clown Prince of Crime's insane scheme. A mysterious ninja is robbing Wayne Enterprises subsidiaries, and Batman discovers that the ninja is actually his equal in combat. A grudge against Bruce Wayne and skills to match him can only mean one person: Kyodai Ken, an old rival of Wayne's teacher from his days in Japan, and who was thrown out of the dojo after attempting to rob it, only to be stopped by Wayne. Ken, it turns out, wants revenge. Batman must stop Roland Daggett's plan to release a viral plague designed by Professor Milo into Gotham by way of its stray cat population. The case gains new urgency when Catwoman becomes infected with the virus during her search for her missing cat, Isis. Now, Batman must find an antidote to save the woman who loves him most. After a prominent judge is injured during a struggle with some thugs demanding money from her in exchange for a strange tape, Bruce Wayne decides to take a trip to Yucca Springs, a resort where the judge had vacationed, and consult Dr. Hugo Strange, a psychiatrist. Bruce soon learns that Strange has invented a machine that extracts people's darkest secrets from their minds and transfers them to videotape — and now Strange has proof of Bruce's secret identity as Batman, and plans to auction it to three of Gotham's prominent crime bosses. Several robberies take place at major companies, including Wayne Enterprises, and Bruce Wayne, as Batman, discovers the thief to be a mechanical briefcase. Bruce meets with his old friend, Karl Rossum, an expert in robotics who lost his daughter to a vehicle accident years ago. He also meets Rossum's assistant, Randa Duane, and Rossum's ultimate creation: a prototype A.I. known as Holographic Analytical Reciprocating Digital Computer (H.A.R.D.A.C.) Bruce invites Duane to dinner, and around the same time, certain civilians start acting strangely. Most surprising is when Duane unexpectedly leaves Wayne Manor while Bruce is on the phone, and the entire Batcave turns on Batman. Batman manages to free himself from the Batcave's clutches, and brings it back under his control, although he fails to track Duane down. Barbara Gordon approaches Batman to inform him of her father's sudden change in behavior. A brutal fight between Batman and Detective Bullock ensues, during which Batman pushes Bullock onto the Bat Signal, and reveals him to actually be an android, meaning that the real Bullock and James Gordon have gone missing, and Batman knows who the culprit is: H.A.R.D.A.C. Can he stop the evil supercomputer before it's too late? Edward Nygma creates the game The Riddle of the Minotaur and makes millions for the company Competitron. He is then fired by his superior, Daniel Mockridge, who wants the profits for himself. Nygma vows revenge, and two years later, he takes up the mantle of the Riddler and traps Mockridge inside a life-sized version of the Minotaur maze. Batman's sympathy is with Nygma, but he and Robin have to stop him before he kills Mockridge, despite the fact that Mockridge cannot legally be brought to justice. Regardless, Mockridge, despite the resulting rescue, is left in a permanent all-consuming fear of Nygma's return for revenge. Cameron Kaiser builds a casino hotel modeled after the Joker, called \"The Joker's Wild\". The Joker sees this on the news and, enraged, escapes from Arkham again, with one thought on his mind: destroying the casino, unaware that this is exactly what Kaiser wants him to do as part of an insurance claim. Selina Kyle is kidnapped by the villainous genetic engineer Dr. Emile Dorian and becomes his latest experiment to provide his man-cat hybrid named Tygrus with a mate. Batman learns of this and comes to the island to rescue Selina. He is captured and forced into a deadly game of cat-and-flying mouse as Tygrus hunts Batman through the island's jungles. Batman investigates the appearance of a werewolf-like creature in Gotham, not realizing that the monster happens to be one of Bruce Wayne's associates — Anthony Romulus, ex-Olympic champion. Behind the scheme is twisted chemist Professor Milo. Kyodai Ken kidnaps Kairi, star pupil of Yoru Sensei, the martial arts instructor who taught both Kyodai and Bruce. The ninja's ransom for her is a scroll that teaches the location of the fabled Death Touch. When a giant-sized bat ransacks Gotham harbor, Batman suspects that Dr. Kirk Langstrom is up to his old tricks, taking the Man-Bat formula again. Batman isn't the only one. Kirk's wife, Francine, is so distrustful of her husband that she decides to leave him. After further investigation, Batman discovers that this Man-Bat is not Kirk, but someone else, and thus he shames Francine's father into permanently destroying the formula. The Joker, Killer Croc, the Penguin, Two-Face, and Poison Ivy all meet at a poker table, each telling a tale of times when they almost defeated Batman. At the same time, Harley Quinn is about to kill Catwoman after she rescued Batman from the Joker's electric chair. Veronica Vreeland is looking for a way to create a splash with her next party, and arrives at the idea of having a former criminal in attendance — especially if there is one whose manners would create a stir. The Penguin, who has recently reformed, fits the bill perfectly. In the process of convincing the Penguin to come to her party, Veronica finds she likes the corpulent little guy. For his part, the Penguin begins to fall in love with her, until he overhears that he is merely being used... Seeking to prove once and for all that his is the superior mind, the Riddler lures Batman into a riddle-solving contest inside the virtual reality of a computer game in order to save Commissioner Gordon's life. In the course of solving the riddles and escaping the Riddler's traps, Batman learns that he is able to manipulate the virtual reality landscape much like the Riddler does. On the anniversary of the death of Bruce's parents, Batman accompanies Leslie Thompkins to Crime Alley to place roses on the spot where they were gunned down. Meanwhile, Commissioner Gordon is on stakeout to arrest James \"The Jazzman\" Peake during a drug smuggling ring. Batman had promised to be there, but arrives late to find a gun battle going on. He helps defeat the gangsters and arrest the Jazzman, but at a high cost—Gordon is severely wounded. The incident traumatizes Batman and he contemplates giving up his crime-fighting career, despite the Jazzman escaping prison to carry out his personal vendetta against Gordon (who had sent him to prison six years before). Can Robin help Batman regain his confidence in time to save Gordon? While following Count Vertigo's trail, Batman encounters Talia, daughter of the head of the Society of Shadows, who was sent by her father to prevent the capture of a sonic drill that the Count stole. But after his identity is mistakenly revealed to Talia, Batman remains off-balance as to where her true loyalties lie. When a small time gang member (Matt Frewer) seemingly kills Batman by accident, he gets involved with gangs all over Gotham, as well as the Joker and Rupert Thorne, none of whom believe his story that everything that is happening is by preposterous happenstance. Clayface is falling apart, literally. His clay-like body is disintegrating. Fortunately, a scientist he knew from his movie star days is working on a remedy. However, Hagen is forced to steal money to pay for the expensive components of the remedy. That is, until one of his targets is Wayne Biomedical Labs... Dr. Matthew Thorne (Joseph Campanella), losing his medical license and forced into becoming the crime doctor by his younger brother, crime boss Rupert Thorne, must perform delicate surgery on Rupert. He can't do it alone, and kidnaps Dr. Leslie Thompkins to assist. Batman discovers Leslie's disappearance, and rushes to track her down - and has an additional interest in Matthew, because he was a medical school classmate of Bruce Wayne's father Thomas. When the glamorous magician Zatanna is framed for a robbery during her act, Batman swings to her defense. Zatanna is grateful, though a little puzzled, by the Dark Knight's commitment to prove her innocence, but the two heroes unite and use the skills her father, Zatara, taught them to expose and combat the culprit: an evil illusionist named Montague Kane. Thanks to a freak accident during a high-speed chase, the Batmobile is virtually demolished. After Batman takes the car to his personal mechanic, Earl Cooper, the Penguin makes his move and tampers with the Batmobile, putting it under his control. When the Joker fires Harley, she tries going on a crime spree of her own, joining up with Poison Ivy, and the two become Gotham's Queens of Crime, much to the Joker's fury. When Commissioner Gordon is framed for taking bribes from Rupert Thorne, his daughter Barbara pleads with Batman to show up at a rally being put on in the commissioner's behalf. But when Batman disappears after finding the person behind the frame-up, Barbara takes the law into her own hands as Batgirl. Robin discovers that Gil Mason is in league with the underworld and goes to investigate him. He encounters Batgirl along the way, and go their separate ways to stop Mason. They then meet again to learn that Gil is working with Two-Face to take out Gordon, and have Batman (as Matches Malone) captured. The Penguin steals an experimental helicopter from an air show, causing an explosion that temporarily blinds Bruce Wayne. Batman knows he won't be able to wait until his vision returns to track the Penguin down, but will he be able to do so without the use of his eyes? When Robin is mysteriously abducted from his college campus, Batman begins a fruitless search... until he is astounded by the sudden appearance in the Batcave of Ra's al Ghul. Ra's quickly reveals that his daughter, Talia, has been abducted under circumstances similar to Robin's, suggesting that the same people are responsible. So begins an uneasy truce between Batman and 'The Demon'. After freeing Talia from her father's clutches and escaping from an avalanche, Batman and Robin follow the only clue they have – the word 'Orpheus'. After discovering that 'Orpheus' is Ra's private satellite that will orbit over the Sahara, the duo travel to the Demon's desert stronghold. There, Batman learns that the satellite is actually a weapon which will explosively destroy all the Lazarus Pits simultaneously throughout the world, destroying all the life that exists. When a Batman impersonator appears in Gotham City, the real Batman deduces that Karl Rossum is somehow involved and confronts the inventor. The other Batman, a duplicate, then shows up and a battle between the two takes place. After the duplicate Batman escapes, it begins its campaign to recreate H.A.R.D.A.C.'s goals of a robotic society. Believing himself to be the reincarnation of Zeus, Maxie Zeus steals an experimental weapon that the government developed. The mad man desires to use the weapon against the people of Gotham City and Batman must put a stop to Maxie's mad plan against the city he loves. A brand-new gang has made its debut committing the slickest crimes ever, thanks to the gang leader, Scarface. It's up to Batman to stop Scarface and his \"dummy\", the Ventriloquist. Wealthy socialite Veronica Vreeland returns from Central America, bringing tiny handmade dolls for all her friends. According to native legend, once placed under a pillow, the dolls do the sleeper's worrying for them. Unknown to Veronica or her guests, each of the dolls was made by the Mad Hatter, and contains a tiny microchip which plantshypnotic suggestions inside the sleepers' brains. A mysterious bat-like creature terrorizes Gotham City, causing the police force to pursue Batman. The Dark Knight must find the real perpetrator to clear his name. Batman encounters the Scarecrow and attempts to foil his scheme to burn down Gotham University, but in the process is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear gas, and is forced to face his own guilt over the death of his parents. The Joker covers Gotham City in a cloud of laughing gas and begins plundering the crazed city. But after Alfred is infected with the toxin, Batman has added incentive to stop the Joker and acquire an antidote from him before all of Gotham dies with a smile. A botched police operation results in the suspension of those involved: Officer Wilkes, Officer Montoya, and Detective Bullock. Confronted by their superiors, each of them is forced to tell their tale of what happened that night. Mayor Hamilton Hill's miserable son, Jordan, becomes even sadder when his father uses his birthday party as a political gathering, and ends up stowing away in the truck of the party clown hired by Hill for the party, whom he doesn't know is actually the Joker in disguise. It is now up to Batman, whom Mayor Hill distrusts, to rescue the boy before it is too late. While Bruce is in Europe on a Wayne Enterprises business trip, the theft of a jade cat statue occurs at Gotham State University. Barbara Gordon again becomes Batgirl to investigate, only to run into Catwoman, who is also investigating, pointing out that the acid residue used to destroy the security system is not her style. The two team up to find the statue, with Robin tailing them, and things go from bad to worse when Roland Daggett is revealed to be involved. Using microchips stolen from the Mad Hatter, the Joker brainwashes famous comedians into committing crazy crimes in order to ruin their reputations. As it turns out, the comedians are the judges who tossed the Joker out of the Gotham Comedy Competition the year before. Now, the Clown Prince of Crime wants to seek his revenge, and Batman and Robin must foil the Joker's plot. Three wealthy, bored friends of Bruce Wayne decide to seek new thrills by becoming master criminals. As the Fox, the Shark and the Vulture (masters of land, sea and air), the Terrible Trio pick Gotham clean, until they encounter one person who cannot be bought off — Batman. The Riddler is hired to work for a toy company, vowing to turn over a new leaf. But Batman refuses to believe he has changed, and he suspects that the Riddler is still obsessed with outsmarting and defeating him. Now, the Dark Knight must prove that Riddler is still a criminal at heart and send him back to Arkham. The Red Claw organization kidnaps Alfred, seeking a code they need to arm a weapon of mass destruction that Alfred knows from his days as a British secret agent. The Joker steals an atomic bomb, and it is up to Batman and Robin to find and stop him. Since there is no time to spare, the duo enlist the help of Harley Quinn to track Joker down. Throughout the episode, it is briefly discussed how Harley met Joker. The Clock King returns to continue his vendetta against Mayor Hill. This time, the time-obsessed criminal hopes to murder Hill with the help of a stolen invention that allows him to warp time and travel at super-speed. Securing another device from its creator, Batman and Robin take on the Clock King in a furious high-speed battle for the mayor's life. Someone has put a hit out on Gotham's toughest cop, Harvey Bullock. After surviving several near misses, Bullock realizes he has no choice but to ask his arch-rival Batman to help him discover who is behind the murder attempts. During their investigation, Bullock learns that his gruff and mean-spirited manner has created enemies in the unlikeliest of people. Note: This episode won the 1996 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction and Composition. The episode was also adapted from a Chuck Dixon story that was published in Detective Comics #651. Ra's al Ghul narrates a story from his past in which Jonah Hex stops his plan to destroy the transcontinental railroad being completed in 1883, by using a war blimp. Not only has Poison Ivy been released from Arkham Asylum, but she's also married to her doctor and settled down to help him raise his two sons. It would appear that Ivy has gone straight and that her old days as a criminal are over. But wealthy bachelors are being struck down by an unknown toxin, leaving Batman to question Ivy's innocence. Mr. Freeze is kidnapped from his prison cell by aging billionaire Grant Walker. Walker is looking to freeze the world and recreate it according to his own design. Batman and Robin infiltrate the billionaire's underwater city and combat both high-tech robots and Mr. Freeze himself, who has personal reasons to do Walker's bidding and cover the Earth in a new ice age. Note: Walker's plot to freeze the world with a giant cannon was later used in Batman & Robin, where Mr. Freeze uses advanced technology to turn an observatory telescope into a freezing cannon to freeze a part of Gotham City and hold the city to ransom. Also, one of Karl Rossum's toy robots seen in this episode is an obvious tribute to the character \"Bat-Mite\". Lyle Bolton, the new head of security at Arkham, is fired for his atrocious mistreatment of the inmates. Six months later, Bolton becomes the vigilante Lock-Up, and decides to put who he feels responsible for the ruin of the city behind bars. It's up to Batman and Robin to save his victims. Just before he is to undergo the operation that will restore his sanity, Harvey Dent is kidnapped by a mysterious villain. Batman and Robin split up to nab the criminal behind the scheme to abduct the Dark Knight's old friend. They suspect that either the Penguin or Rupert Thorne may be behind the kidnapping. But is it really the Penguin or Thorne behind the kidnapping? Or is it someone else with a grudge against Harvey? Harley Quinn is released back into society, proved to be sane. After a misunderstanding at a clothing store, however, a snowball of comedic chaos builds around her. Gotham's new DA, Janet Van Dorn, is out to capture Batman, but both she and him end up captured by a gang of criminals instead. They are soon put on a kangaroo trial by the Joker (the judge), Two-Face (the prosecutor), the Ventriloquist (the bailiff), Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, the Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, the Scarecrow, the Riddler, and other criminals. If the defense (Batman and the D.A.) can prove that Batman is not the cause for everyone's turn to crime, they will be set free. When the jury gives the verdict of 'not guilty', the villains have little intention of following through on their deal. Notes: Henry Polic II, the Scarecrow's voice actor, was recuperating from throat surgery during the episode's production, so his character has no dialogue in it. Also, Van Dorn mentions in this episode that Harley Quinn was once a doctor at Arkham before the Joker corrupted her mind; backstory which is later shown in The New Batman Adventures episode \"Mad Love\". En route to an upstate prison, Killer Croc escapes and leads Batman on a dangerous chase through the wilderness. After throwing Batman temporarily off his trail, the reptile-man takes refuge with a group of retired circus freaks, and convinces them to help him. When Batman arrives, Croc and the freaks band together to capture him. Batman comes face-to-face with his most powerful adversary yet, the chemically-enhanced assassin Bane. Originally hired by Rupert Thorne to kill Batman, Bane plans on taking control of Thorne's criminal empire once Batman is destroyed. It is a fight to the death with all of Gotham in the balance, as Batman takes on the man who has vowed to break the Bat. Anxious to take up her old ways as Catwoman, Selina Kyle joins forces with the Ventriloquist to humiliate socialite Veronica Vreeland. But the real victim is Catwoman herself, who has been secretly set up by Scarface to take the fall for another robbery. Batman has to intercede before the furious feline makes things worse by killing the double-talking Ventriloquist. A washed-up actress named Mary Dahl has become bitter and insane after falling into obscurity and suffering from a disorder that prevents her body from growing to adulthood, thus biologically cursed with literal eternal youth. She kidnaps her TV family, who all led much happier lives and more successful careers than her, and holds them prisoner on the abandoned soundstage of her old show While Robin works fast to free the actors from Baby-Doll's explosive death-trap, Batman pursues the tiny fiend through a deadly carnival funhouse. A mystic Egyptian scroll donated to the Gotham museum by Bruce Wayne is stolen by Ra's al Ghul, and Batman and Talia must join forces to prevent the power-mad Ra's from unlocking the scroll's secrets of life and death. Their quest takes them to a hidden temple deep beneath the Egyptian desert. There, the Dark Knight is forced into a terrifying battle with an ancient Egyptian sorceress."

wrote this letter\nSweeps the pillow clean\nSo rest your head and\nread a treasured dream\nI care for no one else but you\nI tear my soul to cease the pain\nI think maybe you feel the same\nWhat can

amends\nNo purse of token fortune stands in Our way\nThe silent guns of love\nwill blast the sky\nWe broke the ruptured structure built of age\nOur weapons were the tongues of crying rage\nWhere money stood\nWe planted seeds of rebirth\nAnd stabbed the backs of fathers\nSons of dirt\nInfiltrated business cesspools\nHating through Our sleeves\nYea, and We slit the Catholic throat\nStoned the poor\non slogans such as\n'Wish You Could Hear'\n'Love Is All We Need'\n'Kick Out The Jams'\n'Kick Out Your Mother'\n'Cut Up Your Friend'\n'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'\nAnd We Know the Flag of Love is from Above\nAnd We Can Force You to Be Free\nAnd We Can Force You to Believe\"\nAnd I close my eyes and tighten up my brain\nFor I once read a book in which the lovers were slain\nFor they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain\nIt said:\n\"I believe in the Power of Good\nI Believe in the State of Love\nI Will Fight For the Right to be Right\nI Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right\"\nAnd I open my eyes to look around\nAnd I see a child laid slain\non the ground\nAs a love machine lumbers through desolation rows\nPloughing down man,

smile\nLike a Polish wanderer\nI travel ever onwards to your land\nAnd were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand\nYour strange demand\nTo 'collocate' my mind\nScares me into gloom\nYou're too intense\nI'll have to keep you in your place\nI've no defence\nI've got to keep my veil on my face\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to know me well\nBut I've got things inside my head\nThat even I can't face\nJanine, Janine, you'd like to crash\nmy walls\nBut if you take an axe to me\nYou'll kill another man\nNot me at all\nYou're fey, Janine\nA tripper to the last\nBut if I catch you standing on my toes\nI'll have a right to shout you down\nFor you're a lazy stream\nIn which my thoughts would drown\nSo stay, Janine\nAnd we can glide along\nI've caught your wings for laughs\nI'm not obliged

Janine, you'd like to crash\nmy walls\nBut if you take an axe to me\nYou'll kill another man\nNot me at all\n\nI recall how we lived\nOn the corner of a bed\nAnd we'd speak of a Swedish room\nOf hessian and wood\nAnd we'd talk with our eyes\nOf the sweetness in our lives\nAnd tomorrows of rich surprise...\nSome things we could do\nIn our madness\nWe burnt one hundred days\nTime takes time to pass\nAnd I still hold some ashes to me\nAn Occasional Dream\nAnd we'd sleep, oh so close\nBut not really close our eyes\n'Tween the sheets of summer\nbathed in blue...\nGently weeping nights\nIt was long, long ago\nAnd I can't touch your name\nFor the days of fate\nwere strong for you...\nDanced you far from me\nIn my madness\nI see your face in mine\nI keep a photograph\nIt burns my wall with time\nTime\nAn Occasional Dream\nOf mine\nAn Occasional Dream\nOf mine\nAn Occasional Dream\nOf mine\n\nSolemn faced\nThe village settles down\nUndetected by the stars\nAnd the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep\nAnd the last thing on his mind\nIs the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned\n'Neath the covered wooden shaft\nFolds the rope\nInto its bag\nBlows his pipe of smolders\nBlankets smoke into the room\nAnd the day will end for some\nAs the night begins for one\nStaring through the message in his eyes\nLies a solitary son\nFrom the mountain called Freecloud\nWhere the eagle dare not fly\nAnd the patience in his sigh\nGives no indication\nFor the townsmen to decide\nSo the village Dreadful yawns\nPronouncing gross diversion\nAs the label for the dog\nOh \"It's the madness in his eyes\"\nAs he breaks the night to cry:\n\"It's really Me\nReally You\nAnd really Me\nIt's so hard for us to really be\nReally You\nAnd really Me\nYou'll lose me though I'm always\nreally free\"\nAnd the mountain moved its eyes\nTo the world of realize\nWhere the snow had saved a place\nFor the Wild Eyed Boy\nfrom Freecloud\nAnd the village Dreadful cried\nAs the rope began to rise\nFor the smile stayed on the face\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy\nfrom Freecloud\nAnd the women once proud\nClutched the heart of the crowd\nAs the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand\nAnd the Magic in the stare\nOf the Wild Eyed Boy said\n\"Stop, Freecloud\nThey won't think to cut me down\"\nBut the cottages fell\nLike a playing card hell\nAnd the tears on the face\nOf the Wise Boy\nCame tumbling down\nTo the rumbling ground\nAnd the missionary mystic of peace/love\nStumbled to cry among the clouds\nKicking back the pebbles\nFrom the Freecloud mountain\nTrack.\n\nI was walking through the counters of a national concern\nAnd a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder\nAnd I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean\nAs the merchandise exchanged and money roared\nAnd a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak\nInto the paper bag at her side\nAnd her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed\nSo she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind\nCrying\n\"God knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod may look the other way today\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod may look the other way today\"\nThen she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag\nPerspiration trickled down her forehead\nAnd her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder\nShe was led away bewildered and amazed\nThrough her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter\nAs her escort asked her softly\nfor her name\nAnd a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady\nWho had fainted to the whirling\nwooden floor\nCrying\n\"God knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nSurely God won't look\nthe other way\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nGod knows I'm good\nSurely God won't look\nthe other way\"\n\nThe Children of the summer's end\nGathered in the dampened grass\nWe played Our songs and felt the London sky\nResting on our hands\nIt was God's land\nIt was ragged and naive\nIt was Heaven\nTouch, We touched the very soul\nOf holding each and every life\nWe claimed the very source of joy ran through\nIt didn't, but it seemed that way\nI kissed a lot of people that day\nOh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon\nTo paint that love\nupon a white balloon\nAnd fly it from\nthe topest top of all the tops\nThat man has pushed beyond his brain\nSatori must be something\njust the same\nWe scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size\nWe talked with tall Venusians passing through\nAnd Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head\nAnd away they soared\nClimbing through\nthe ivory vibrant cloud\nSomeone passed some bliss among the crowd\nAnd We walked back to the road, unchained\n\"The Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party\nThe Sun Machine is Coming Down, and We're Gonna Have a Party.\"\n\nIn the corner of the morning in the past\nI would sit and blame the master first and last\nAll the roads were straight and narrow\nAnd the prayers were small and yellow\nAnd the rumour spread that I was aging fast\nThen I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.\nAnd I looked and frowned and the monster was me\nWell, I said hello and I said hello\nAnd I asked \"Why not?\" and I replied \"I don't know\"\nSo we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be\nAnd he laughed insane and quipped \"KAHLIL GIBRAN\"\nSo I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through\nFor I realized that God's a young man too\nSo I said \"So long\" and I waved \"Bye-bye\"\nAnd I smashed my soul and traded my mind\nGot laid by a young bordello\nI was vaguely half asleep\nFor which my reputation swept back home in drag\nAnd the moral of this magic spell\nNegotiates my hide\nWhen God did take my logic for a ride\n(Riding along)\nHe swallowed his pride and puckered his lips\nAnd showed me the leather belt round his hips\nMy knees were shaking my cheeks aflame\nHe said \"You'll never go down to the Gods again\"\n(Turn around,go back!)\nHe struck the ground a cavern appeared\nAnd I smelt the burning pit of fear\nWe crashed a thousand yards below\nI said \"Do it again, do it again\"\n(Turn around,go back!)\nHis nebulous body swayed above\nHis tongue swollen with devil's love\nThe snake and I, a venom high\nI said \"Do it again, do it again\"\n(Turn around, go back!)\nBreathe, breathe, breathe deeply\nAnd I was seething, breathing deeply\nSpitting sentry, horned and tailed\nWaiting for you\n\nDay after day\nThey send my friends away\nTo mansions cold and grey\nTo the far side of town\nWhere the thin men stalk the streets\nWhile the sane stay underground\nDay after day\nThey tell me I can go\nThey tell me I can blow\nTo the far side of town\nWhere it's pointless to be high\n'Cause it's such a long way down\nSo I tell them that\nI can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm\nI will do me harm\nHere I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall\nI'm not quite right at all...am I?\nDon't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be\nJust my librium and me\nAnd my E.S.T. makes three\n'Cause I'd rather stay here\nWith all the madmen\nThan perish with the sadmen roaming free\nAnd I'd rather play here\nWith all the madmen\nFor I'm quite content they're all as sane as me\n(Where can the horizon lie\nWhen a nation hides\nIts organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim\nThey must be very dim)\nDay after day\nThey take some brain away\nThen turn my face around\nTo the far side of town\nAnd tell me that it's real\nThen ask me how I feel\nHere I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall\nI'm not quite right at all\nDon't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be\nMy libido's split on me\nGimme some good 'ole lobotomy\n'Cause I'd rather stay here\nWith all the madmen\nThan perish with the sadmen\nRoaming free And I'd rather play here\nWith all the madmen\nFor I'm quite content\nThey're all as sane as me\nZane, Zane, Zane Ouvre le Chien\n\nPack a pack horse up and rest up here on\nBlack Country Rock\nYou never know, you might find it here on\nBlack Country Rock\nSome say the view is crazy\nBut you may adopt another point of view\nSo if it's much too hazy\nYou can leave my friend and me with fond adieu\n\nPlease trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo\nThere's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo\nWe're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies,\nFrom paradise\nBut they think that we're holding a secretive ball.\nWon't someone invite them\nThey're just taller children, that's all, after all\nMan is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo\nSo hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo\nSome people are marching together and some on their own\nQuite alone\nOthers are running, the smaller ones crawl\nBut some sit in silence, they're just older children\nThat's all, after all\nI sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words\nI've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called\nBut the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all\nLive till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo\nForget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo\nAfter all, after all\n\nI count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy\nSo I better get away, better make it today\nI've cut twenty-three down since Friday\nBut I can't control it, my face is drawn\nMy instinct still emotes it\nI slash them cold, I kill them dead\nI broke the gooks, I cracked their heads\nI'll bomb them out from under the beds\nBut now I've got the running gun blues\nIt seems the peacefuls stopped the war\nLeft generals squashed and stifled\nBut I'll slip out again tonight\nCause they haven't taken back my rifle\nFor I promote oblivion\nAnd I'll plug a few civilians\nI'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead\nI'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads\nI'll slice them till they're running red\nBut now I've got the running gun blues\n\nPresident Joe once had a dream\nThe world held his hand, gave their pledge\nSo he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine\nThey called it the Prayer, its answer was law\nIts logic stopped war, gave them food\nHow they adored till it cried in its boredom\n'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me\nLife is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now\nor maybe a war, or I may kill you all\nDon't let me stay, don't let me stay\nMy logic says burn so send me away\nYour minds are too green, I despise all I've seen\nYou can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine\nI need you flying, and I'll show that dying\nIs living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time\nI perceive every sign, I can steal every mind\nDon't let me stay, don't let me stay\nMy logic says burn so send me away\nYour minds are too green, I despise all I've seen\nYou can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine\n\nWe met upon a hill, the night was cool and still\nShe sucked my dormant will\nMother, she blew my brain, I will go back again\nMy God, she shook me cold\nI had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair\nAnd threw her to the ground\nFather, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said\nMy God, she should be told\nI was very smart, broke the gentle hearts\nOf many young virgins\nI was quick on the ball, left them so lonely\nThey'd just give up trying\nThen she took my head, smashed it up\nKept my young blood rising\nCrushed me mercilessly, kept me going around\nSo she didn't know I crave her so-o-o\nI'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again\nWe met upon a hill\nMother, she blew my brain, I will go back again\nMy God, she shook me cold\n\nWe passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when\nAlthough I wasn't there, he said I was his friend\nWhich came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes\nI thought you died alone, a long long time ago\nOh no, not me\nI never lost control\nYou're face to face\nWith The Man Who Sold The World\nI laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home\nI searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed\nI gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here\nWe must have died alone, a long long time ago\nWho knows? not me\nWe never lost control\nYou're face to face\nWith the Man who Sold the World\n\nWhen all the world was very young\nAnd mountain magic heavy hung\nThe supermen would walk in file\nGuardians of a loveless isle\nAnd gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives\nCould heave nor sigh\nIn solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life\nStrange games they would play then\nNo death for the perfect men\nLife rolls into one for them\nSo softly a supergod cries\nWhere all were minds in uni-thought\nPower weird by mystics taught\nNo pain, no joy, no power too great\nColossal strength to grasp a fate\nWhere sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers\nNightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold\nA man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die\nTo turn to mold.\nFar out in the red-sky\nFar out from the sad eyes\nStrange, mad celebration\nSo softly a supergod cries\nFar out in the red-sky\nFar out from the sad eyes\nStrange, mad celebration\nSo softly a supergod dies\n\nI still don't know what I was waiting for\nAnd my time was running wild\nA million dead-end streets\nAnd every time I thought I'd got it made\nIt seemed the taste was not so sweet\nSo I turned myself to face me\nBut I've never caught a glimpse\nOf how the others must see the faker\nI'm much too fast to take that test\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nDon't want to be a richer man\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nJust gonna have to be a different man\nTime may change me\nBut I can't trace time\nI watch the ripples change their size\nBut never leave the stream\nOf warm impermanence and\nSo the days float through my eyes\nBut still the days seem the same\nAnd these children that you spit on\nAs they try to change their worlds\nAre immune to your consultations\nThey're quite aware of what they're going through\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nDon't tell them to grow up and out of it\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nWhere's your shame\nYou've left us up to our necks in it\nTime may change me\nBut you can't trace time\nStrange fascination, fascinating me\nChanges are taking the pace\nI'm going through\nCh-ch-ch-ch-Changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nOh, look out you rock 'n rollers\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes\n(Turn and face the strange)\nCh-ch-changes\nPretty soon now you're gonna get older\nTime may change me\nBut I can't trace time\nI said that time may change me\nBut I can't trace time\n\nWake up you sleepy head\nPut on some clothes,\nshake up your bed\nPut another log on the fire for me\nI've made some breakfast and coffee\nLook out my window and what do I see\nA crack in the sky\nand a hand reaching down to me\nAll the nightmares came today\nAnd it looks as though they're\nhere to stay\nWhat are we coming to\nNo room for me,\nno fun for you\nI think about a world to come\nWhere the books were found\nby the Golden ones\nWritten in pain, written in awe\nBy a puzzled man who questioned\nWhat we were here for\nAll the strangers came today\nAnd it looks as though\nthey're here to stay\n\nOh You Pretty Things\nDon't you know you're driving your\nMamas and

rather be scared\nTogether than alone\nAh, Here she comes...\nNow hear this Robert Zimmerman\nThough I don't suppose we'll meet\nAsk your good friend Dylan\nIf he'd gaze a while\ndown the old

Why, nothing, only,\nYour inference therefrom!\n\n\nTHE OUTLET.\n\nMy river runs to thee:\nBlue sea, wilt welcome me?\n\nMy river waits reply.\nOh sea, look graciously!\n\nI'll fetch thee brooks\nFrom spotted nooks, —\n\nSay, sea,\nTake me!\n\n\nIN VAIN.\n\nI cannot live with you,\nIt would be life,\nAnd life is over there\nBehind the shelf\n\nThe sexton keeps the key to,\nPutting up\nOur life, his porcelain,\nLike a cup\n\nDiscarded of the housewife,\nQuaint or broken;\nA newer Sevres pleases,\nOld ones crack.\n\nI could not die with you,\nFor one must wait\nTo shut the other's gaze down, —\nYou could not.\n\nAnd I, could I stand by\nAnd see you freeze,\nWithout my right of frost,\nDeath's privilege?\n\nNor could I rise with you,\nBecause your face\nWould put out Jesus',\nThat new grace\n\nGlow plain and foreign\nOn my homesick eye,\nExcept that you, than he\nShone closer by.\n\nThey'd judge us — how?\nFor you served Heaven, you know,\nOr sought to;\nI could not,\n\nBecause you saturated sight,\nAnd I had no more eyes\nFor sordid excellence\nAs Paradise.\n\nAnd were you lost, I would be,\nThough my name\nRang loudest\nOn the heavenly fame.\n\nAnd were you saved,\nAnd I condemned to be\nWhere you were not,\nThat self were hell to me.\n\nSo we must keep apart,\nYou there, I here,\nWith just the door ajar\nThat oceans are,\nAnd prayer,\nAnd that pale sustenance,\nDespair!\n\n\nRENUNCIATION.\n\nFirst page of Renunciation Second page of Renunciation Third page of Renunciation Fourth page of Renunciation\n\n\nThere came a day at summer's full\nEntirely for me;\nI thought that such were for the saints,\nWhere revelations be.\n\nThe sun, as common, went abroad,\nThe flowers, accustomed, blew,\nAs if no soul the solstice passed\nThat maketh all things new.\n\nThe time was scarce profaned by speech;\nThe symbol of a word\nWas needless, as at sacrament\nThe wardrobe of our Lord.\n\nEach was to each the sealed church,\nPermitted to commune this time,\nLest we too awkward show\nAt supper of the Lamb.\n\nThe hours slid fast, as hours will,\nClutched tight by greedy hands;\nSo faces on two decks look back,\nBound to opposing lands.\n\nAnd so, when all the time had failed,\nWithout external sound,\nEach bound the other's crucifix,\nWe gave no other bond.\n\nSufficient troth that we shall rise —\nDeposed, at length, the grave —\nTo that new marriage, justified\nThrough Calvaries of Love!\n\n\nLOVE'S BAPTISM.\n\nI'm ceded, I've stopped being theirs;\nThe name they dropped upon my face\nWith water, in the country church,\nIs finished using now,\nAnd they can put it with my dolls,\nMy childhood, and the string of spools\nI've finished threading too.\n\nBaptized before without the choice,\nBut this time consciously, of grace\nUnto supremest name,\nCalled to my full, the crescent dropped,\nExistence's whole arc filled up\nWith one small diadem.\n\nMy second rank, too small the first,\nCrowned, crowing on my father's breast,\nA half unconscious queen;\nBut this time, adequate, erect,\nWith will to choose or to reject.\nAnd I choose — just a throne.\n\n\nRESURRECTION.\n\n'T was a long parting, but the time\nFor interview had come;\nBefore the judgment-seat of God,\nThe last and second time\n\nThese fleshless lovers met,\nA heaven in a gaze,\nA heaven of heavens, the privilege\nOf one another's eyes.\n\nNo lifetime set on them,\nApparelled as the new\nUnborn, except they had beheld,\nBorn everlasting now.\n\nWas bridal e'er like this?\nA paradise, the host,\nAnd cherubim and seraphim\nThe most familiar guest.\n\n\nAPOCALYPSE.\n\nI'm wife; I've finished that,\nThat other state;\nI'm Czar, I'm woman now:\nIt's safer so.\n\nHow odd the girl's life looks\nBehind this soft eclipse!\nI think that earth seems so\nTo those in heaven now.\n\nThis being comfort, then\nThat other kind was pain;\nBut why compare?\nI'm wife! stop there!\n\n\nTHE WIFE.\n\nShe rose to his requirement, dropped\nThe playthings of her life\nTo take the honorable work\nOf woman and of wife.\n\nIf aught she missed in her new day\nOf amplitude, or awe,\nOr first prospective, or the gold\nIn using wore away,\n\nIt lay unmentioned, as the sea\nDevelops pearl and weed,\nBut only to himself is known\nThe fathoms they abide.\n\n\nAPOTHEOSIS.\n\nCome slowly, Eden!\nLips unused to thee,\nBashful, sip thy jasmines,\nAs the fainting bee,\n\nReaching late his flower,\nRound her chamber hums,\nCounts his nectars — enters,\nAnd is lost in balms!\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. NATURE.\n\n\nNew feet within my garden go,\nNew fingers stir the sod;\nA troubadour upon the elm\nBetrays the solitude.\n\nNew children play upon the green,\nNew weary sleep below;\nAnd still the pensive spring returns,\nAnd still the punctual snow!\n\n\nMAY-FLOWER.\n\nPink, small, and punctual,\nAromatic, low,\nCovert in April,\nCandid in May,\n\nDear to the moss,\nKnown by the knoll,\nNext to the robin\nIn every human soul.\n\nBold little beauty,\nBedecked with thee,\nNature forswears\nAntiquity.\n\n\nWHY?\n\nThe murmur of a bee\nA witchcraft yieldeth me.\nIf any ask me why,\n'T were easier to die\nThan tell.\n\nThe red upon the hill\nTaketh away my will;\nIf anybody sneer,\nTake care, for God is here,\nThat's all.\n\nThe breaking of the day\nAddeth to my degree;\nIf any ask me how,\nArtist, who drew me so,\nMust tell!\n\n\nPerhaps you'd like to buy a flower?\nBut I could never sell.\nIf you would like to borrow\nUntil the daffodil\n\nUnties her yellow bonnet\nBeneath the village door,\nUntil the bees, from clover rows\nTheir hock and sherry draw,\n\nWhy, I will lend until just then,\nBut not an hour more!\n\n\nThe pedigree of honey\nDoes not concern the bee;\nA clover, any time, to him\nIs aristocracy.\n\n\nA SERVICE OF SONG.\n\nSome keep the Sabbath going to church;\nI keep it staying at home,\nWith a bobolink for a chorister,\nAnd an orchard for a dome.\n\nSome keep the Sabbath in surplice;\nI just wear my wings,\nAnd instead of tolling the bell for church,\nOur little sexton sings.\n\nGod preaches, — a noted clergyman, —\nAnd the sermon is never long;\nSo instead of getting to heaven at last,\nI'm going all along!\n\n\nThe bee is not afraid of me,\nI know the butterfly;\nThe pretty people in the woods\nReceive me cordially.\n\nThe brooks laugh louder when I come,\nThe breezes madder play.\nWherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?\nWherefore, O summer's day?\n\n\nSUMMER'S ARMIES.\n\nSome rainbow coming from the fair!\nSome vision of the world Cashmere\nI confidently see!\nOr else a peacock's purple train,\nFeather by feather, on the plain\nFritters itself away!\n\nThe dreamy butterflies bestir,\nLethargic pools resume the whir\nOf last year's sundered tune.\nFrom some old fortress on the sun\nBaronial bees march, one by one,\nIn murmuring platoon!\n\nThe robins stand as thick to-day\nAs flakes of snow stood yesterday,\nOn fence and roof and twig.\nThe orchis binds her feather on\nFor her old lover, Don the Sun,\nRevisiting the bog!\n\nWithout commander, countless, still,\nThe regiment of wood and hill\nIn bright detachment stand.\nBehold! Whose multitudes are these?\nThe children of whose turbaned seas,\nOr what Circassian land?\n\n\nTHE GRASS.\n\nThe grass so little has to do, —\nA sphere of simple green,\nWith only butterflies to brood,\nAnd bees to entertain,\n\nAnd stir all day to pretty tunes\nThe breezes fetch along,\nAnd hold the sunshine in its lap\nAnd bow to everything;\n\nAnd thread the dews all night, like pearls,\nAnd make itself so fine, —\nA duchess were too common\nFor such a noticing.\n\nAnd even when it dies, to pass\nIn odors so divine,\nAs lowly spices gone to sleep,\nOr amulets of pine.\n\nAnd then to dwell in sovereign barns,\nAnd dream the days away, —\nThe grass so little has to do,\nI wish I were the hay!\n\n\nA little road not made of man,\nEnabled of the eye,\nAccessible to thill of bee,\nOr cart of butterfly.\n\nIf town it have, beyond itself,\n'T is that I cannot say;\nI only sigh, — no vehicle\nBears me along that way.\n\n\nSUMMER SHOWER.\n\nA drop fell on the apple tree,\nAnother on the roof;\nA half a dozen kissed the eaves,\nAnd made the gables laugh.\n\nA few went out to help the brook,\nThat went to help the sea.\nMyself conjectured, Were they pearls,\nWhat necklaces could be!\n\nThe dust replaced in hoisted roads,\nThe birds jocoser sung;\nThe sunshine threw his hat away,\nThe orchards spangles hung.\n\nThe breezes brought dejected lutes,\nAnd bathed them in the glee;\nThe East put out a single flag,\nAnd signed the fete away.\n\n\nPSALM OF THE DAY.\n\nA something in a summer's day,\nAs slow her flambeaux burn away,\nWhich solemnizes me.\n\nA something in a summer's noon, —\nAn azure depth, a wordless tune,\nTranscending ecstasy.\n\nAnd still within a summer's night\nA something so transporting bright,\nI clap my hands to see;\n\nThen veil my too inspecting face,\nLest such a subtle, shimmering grace\nFlutter too far for me.\n\nThe wizard-fingers never rest,\nThe purple brook within the breast\nStill chafes its narrow bed;\n\nStill rears the East her amber flag,\nGuides still the sun along the crag\nHis caravan of red,\n\nLike flowers that heard the tale of dews,\nBut never deemed the dripping prize\nAwaited their low brows;\n\nOr bees, that thought the summer's name\nSome rumor of delirium\nNo summer could for them;\n\nOr Arctic creature, dimly stirred\nBy tropic hint, — some travelled bird\nImported to the wood;\n\nOr wind's bright signal to the ear,\nMaking that homely and severe,\nContented, known, before\n\nThe heaven unexpected came,\nTo lives that thought their worshipping\nA too presumptuous psalm.\n\n\nTHE SEA OF SUNSET.\n\nThis is the land the sunset washes,\nThese are the banks of the Yellow Sea;\nWhere it rose, or whither it rushes,\nThese are the western mystery!\n\nNight after night her purple traffic\nStrews the landing with opal bales;\nMerchantmen poise upon horizons,\nDip, and vanish with fairy sails.\n\n\nPURPLE CLOVER.\n\nThere is a flower that bees prefer,\nAnd butterflies desire;\nTo gain the purple democrat\nThe humming-birds aspire.\n\nAnd whatsoever insect pass,\nA honey bears away\nProportioned to his several dearth\nAnd her capacity.\n\nHer face is rounder than the moon,\nAnd ruddier than the gown\nOf orchis in the pasture,\nOr rhododendron worn.\n\nShe doth not wait for June;\nBefore the world is green\nHer sturdy little countenance\nAgainst the wind is seen,\n\nContending with the grass,\nNear kinsman to herself,\nFor privilege of sod and sun,\nSweet litigants for life.\n\nAnd when the hills are full,\nAnd newer fashions blow,\nDoth not retract a single spice\nFor pang of jealousy.\n\nHer public is the noon,\nHer providence the sun,\nHer progress by the bee proclaimed\nIn sovereign, swerveless tune.\n\nThe bravest of the host,\nSurrendering the last,\nNor even of defeat aware\nWhen cancelled by the frost.\n\n\nTHE BEE.\n\nLike trains of cars on tracks of plush\nI hear the level bee:\nA jar across the flowers goes,\nTheir velvet masonry\n\nWithstands until the sweet assault\nTheir chivalry consumes,\nWhile he, victorious, tilts away\nTo vanquish other blooms.\n\nHis feet are shod with gauze,\nHis helmet is of gold;\nHis breast, a single onyx\nWith chrysoprase, inlaid.\n\nHis labor is a chant,\nHis idleness a tune;\nOh, for a bee's experience\nOf clovers and of noon!\n\n\nPresentiment is that long shadow on the lawn\nIndicative that suns go down;\nThe notice to the startled grass\nThat darkness is about to pass.\n\n\nAs children bid the guest good-night,\nAnd then reluctant turn,\nMy flowers raise their pretty lips,\nThen put their nightgowns on.\n\nAs children caper when they wake,\nMerry that it is morn,\nMy flowers from a hundred cribs\nWill peep, and prance again.\n\n\nAngels in the early morning\nMay be seen the dews among,\nStooping, plucking, smiling, flying:\nDo the buds to them belong?\n\nAngels when the sun is hottest\nMay be seen the sands among,\nStooping, plucking, sighing, flying;\nParched the flowers they bear along.\n\n\nSo bashful when I spied her,\nSo pretty, so ashamed!\nSo hidden in her leaflets,\nLest anybody find;\n\nSo breathless till I passed her,\nSo helpless when I turned\nAnd bore her, struggling, blushing,\nHer simple haunts beyond!\n\nFor whom I robbed the dingle,\nFor whom betrayed the dell,\nMany will doubtless ask me,\nBut I shall never tell!\n\n\nTWO WORLDS.\n\nIt makes no difference abroad,\nThe seasons fit the same,\nThe mornings blossom into noons,\nAnd split their pods of flame.\n\nWild-flowers kindle in the woods,\nThe brooks brag all the day;\nNo blackbird bates his jargoning\nFor passing Calvary.\n\nAuto-da-fe and judgment\nAre nothing to the bee;\nHis separation from his rose\nTo him seems misery.\n\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN.\n\nThe mountain sat upon the plain\nIn his eternal chair,\nHis observation omnifold,\nHis inquest everywhere.\n\nThe seasons prayed around his knees,\nLike children round a sire:\nGrandfather of the days is he,\nOf dawn the ancestor.\n\n\nA DAY.\n\nI'll tell you how the sun rose, —\nA ribbon at a time.\nThe steeples swam in amethyst,\nThe news like squirrels ran.\n\nThe hills untied their bonnets,\nThe bobolinks begun.\nThen I said softly to myself,\n\"That must have been the sun!\"\n\n* * *\n\nBut how he set, I know not.\nThere seemed a purple stile\nWhich little yellow boys and girls\nWere climbing all the while\n\nTill when they reached the other side,\nA dominie in gray\nPut gently up the evening bars,\nAnd led the flock away.\n\n\nThe butterfly's assumption-gown,\nIn chrysoprase apartments hung,\nThis afternoon put on.\n\nHow condescending to descend,\nAnd be of buttercups the friend\nIn a New England town!\n\n\nTHE WIND.\n\nOf all the sounds despatched abroad,\nThere's not a charge to me\nLike that old measure in the boughs,\nThat phraseless melody\n\nThe wind does, working like a hand\nWhose fingers brush the sky,\nThen quiver down, with tufts of tune\nPermitted gods and me.\n\nWhen winds go round and round in bands,\nAnd thrum upon the door,\nAnd birds take places overhead,\nTo bear them orchestra,\n\nI crave him grace, of summer boughs,\nIf such an outcast be,\nHe never heard that fleshless chant\nRise solemn in the tree,\n\nAs if some caravan of sound\nOn deserts, in the sky,\nHad broken rank,\nThen knit, and passed\nIn seamless company.\n\n\nDEATH AND LIFE.\n\nApparently with no surprise\nTo any happy flower,\nThe frost beheads it at its play\nIn accidental power.\nThe blond assassin passes on,\nThe sun proceeds unmoved\nTo measure off another day\nFor an approving God.\n\n\n'T was later when the summer went\nThan when the cricket came,\nAnd yet we knew that gentle clock\nMeant nought but going home.\n\n'T was sooner when the cricket went\nThan when the winter came,\nYet that pathetic pendulum\nKeeps esoteric time.\n\n\nINDIAN SUMMER.\n\nThese are the days when birds come back,\nA very few, a bird or two,\nTo take a backward look.\n\nThese are the days when skies put on\nThe old, old sophistries of June, —\nA blue and gold mistake.\n\nOh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,\nAlmost thy plausibility\nInduces my belief,\n\nTill ranks of seeds their witness bear,\nAnd softly through the altered air\nHurries a timid leaf!\n\nOh, sacrament of summer days,\nOh, last communion in the haze,\nPermit a child to join,\n\nThy sacred emblems to partake,\nThy consecrated bread to break,\nTaste thine immortal wine!\n\n\nAUTUMN.\n\nThe morns are meeker than they were,\nThe nuts are getting brown;\nThe berry's cheek is plumper,\nThe rose is out of town.\n\nThe maple wears a gayer scarf,\nThe field a scarlet gown.\nLest I should be old-fashioned,\nI'll put a trinket on.\n\n\nBECLOUDED.\n\nThe sky is low, the clouds are mean,\nA travelling flake of snow\nAcross a barn or through a rut\nDebates if it will go.\n\nA narrow wind complains all day\nHow some one treated him;\nNature, like us, is sometimes caught\nWithout her diadem.\n\n\nTHE HEMLOCK.\n\nI think the hemlock likes to stand\nUpon a marge of snow;\nIt suits his own austerity,\nAnd satisfies an awe\n\nThat men must slake in wilderness,\nOr in the desert cloy, —\nAn instinct for the hoar, the bald,\nLapland's necessity.\n\nThe hemlock's nature thrives on cold;\nThe gnash of northern winds\nIs sweetest nutriment to him,\nHis best Norwegian wines.\n\nTo satin races he is nought;\nBut children on the Don\nBeneath his tabernacles play,\nAnd Dnieper wrestlers run.\n\n\nThere's a certain slant of light,\nOn winter afternoons,\nThat oppresses, like the weight\nOf cathedral tunes.\n\nHeavenly hurt it gives us;\nWe can find no scar,\nBut internal difference\nWhere the meanings are.\n\nNone may teach it anything,\n' T is the seal, despair, —\nAn imperial affliction\nSent us of the air.\n\nWhen it comes, the landscape listens,\nShadows hold their breath;\nWhen it goes, 't is like the distance\nOn the look of death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\n\nOne dignity delays for all,\nOne mitred afternoon.\nNone can avoid this purple,\nNone evade this crown.\n\nCoach it insures, and footmen,\nChamber and state and throng;\nBells, also, in the village,\nAs we ride grand along.\n\nWhat dignified attendants,\nWhat service when we pause!\nHow loyally at parting\nTheir hundred hats they raise!\n\nHow pomp surpassing ermine,\nWhen simple you and I\nPresent our meek escutcheon,\nAnd claim the rank to die!\n\n\nTOO LATE.\n\nDelayed till she had ceased to know,\nDelayed till in its vest of snow\nHer loving bosom lay.\nAn hour behind the fleeting breath,\nLater by just an hour than death, —\nOh, lagging yesterday!\n\nCould she have guessed that it would be;\nCould but a crier of the glee\nHave climbed the distant hill;\nHad not the bliss so slow a pace, —\nWho knows but this surrendered face\nWere undefeated still?\n\nOh, if there may departing be\nAny forgot by victory\nIn her imperial round,\nShow them this meek apparelled thing,\nThat could not stop to be a king,\nDoubtful if it be crowned!\n\n\nASTRA CASTRA.\n\nDeparted to the judgment,\nA mighty afternoon;\nGreat clouds like ushers leaning,\nCreation looking on.\n\nThe flesh surrendered, cancelled,\nThe bodiless begun;\nTwo worlds, like audiences, disperse\nAnd leave the soul alone.\n\n\nSafe in their alabaster chambers,\nUntouched by morning and untouched by noon,\nSleep the meek members of the resurrection,\nRafter of satin, and roof of stone.\n\nLight laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;\nBabbles the bee in a stolid ear;\nPipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, —\nAh, what sagacity perished here!\n\nGrand go the years in the crescent above them;\nWorlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,\nDiadems drop and Doges surrender,\nSoundless as dots on a disk of snow.\n\n\nOn this long storm the rainbow rose,\nOn this late morn the sun;\nThe clouds, like listless elephants,\nHorizons straggled down.\n\nThe birds rose smiling in their nests,\nThe gales indeed were done;\nAlas! how heedless were the eyes\nOn whom the summer shone!\n\nThe quiet nonchalance of death\nNo daybreak can bestir;\nThe slow archangel's syllables\nMust awaken her.\n\n\nFROM THE CHRYSALIS.\n\nMy cocoon tightens, colors tease,\nI'm feeling for the air;\nA dim capacity for wings\nDegrades the dress I wear.\n\nA power of butterfly must be\nThe aptitude to fly,\nMeadows of majesty concedes\nAnd easy sweeps of sky.\n\nSo I must baffle at the hint\nAnd cipher at the sign,\nAnd make much blunder, if at last\nI take the clew divine.\n\n\nSETTING SAIL.\n\nExultation is the going\nOf an inland soul to sea, —\nPast the houses, past the headlands,\nInto deep eternity!\n\nBred as we, among the mountains,\nCan the sailor understand\nThe divine intoxication\nOf the first league out from land?\n\n\nLook back on time with kindly eyes,\nHe doubtless did his best;\nHow softly sinks his trembling sun\nIn human nature's west!\n\n\nA train went through a burial gate,\nA bird broke forth and sang,\nAnd trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat\nTill all the churchyard rang;\n\nAnd then adjusted his little notes,\nAnd bowed and sang again.\nDoubtless, he thought it meet of him\nTo say good-by to men.\n\n\nI died for beauty, but was scarce\nAdjusted in the tomb,\nWhen one who died for truth was lain\nIn an adjoining room.\n\nHe questioned softly why I failed?\n\"For beauty,\" I replied.\n\"And I for truth, — the two are one;\nWe brethren are,\" he said.\n\nAnd so, as kinsmen met a night,\nWe talked between the rooms,\nUntil the moss had reached our lips,\nAnd covered up our names.\n\n\n\"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS.\"\n\nHow many times these low feet staggered,\nOnly the soldered mouth can tell;\nTry!

HIGGINSON\n\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe eagerness with which the first volume of Emily Dickinson's poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern artificiality does not prevent a prompt \nappreciation of the qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest themes,—life and love and death. That \"irresistible needle-touch,\" as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling power. This second volume, while open to the same criticism as to form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties. \nAlthough Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her \nfriend \"H.H.\" must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated 5th September, 1884, she wrote:— \nMY DEAR FRIEND,— What portfolios full of verses you must have! It is a cruel wrong to your \"day and generation\" that you will not give them light.\n\nIf such a thing should happen as that I should outlive you, I wish you would make me your literary legatee and executor. Surely after you are what is called \"dead\" you will be \nwilling that the poor ghosts you have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your verses, will you not? You ought to be. I do not think we have a right to withhold from the world a word or a thought any more than a deed which might help a single soul. . . . \nTruly yours,\n\nHELEN JACKSON.\n\nThe \"portfolios\" were found, shortly after Emily Dickinson's death, by her sister and only surviving housemate. Most of the poems had been carefully copied on sheets of \nnote-paper, and tied in little fascicules, each of six or eight sheets. While many of them bear evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had received thoughtful revision. There is the frequent addition of rather perplexing foot-notes, affording large choice of words and phrases. And in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one form, sometimes another, is found to have been used. Without important exception, her friends have generously placed at the disposal of the Editors any poems they had received from her; and these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several renderings of the same verse. \nTo what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know. They should be regarded in many cases as merely the first \nstrong and suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some time in the finished picture. \nEmily Dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the winter of 1862. In a letter to one of the present Editors the April following, she says, \"I made no verse, but \none or two, until this winter.\"\nThe handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running Italian hand of our elder gentlewomen; but as she advanced in breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more \nabrupt, until in her latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its fellows. In most of her poems, particularly the later ones, everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous dashes; and all important words began with capitals. The effect of a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and strong. The fac-simile given in the present volume is from one of the earlier transition periods. Although there is nowhere a date, the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general chronologic accuracy. \nAs a rule, the verses were without titles; but \"A Country Burial,\" \"A Thunder-Storm,\" \"The Humming-Bird,\" and a few others were named by their author, frequently at the \nend,—sometimes only in the accompanying note, if sent to a friend. \nThe variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all \ninterference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes. \nLike impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily Dickinson's exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic \nfitness of a particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything virtually extrinsic; and her verses all show a strange cadence of inner rhythmical music. Lines are always daringly constructed, and the \"thought-rhyme\" appears frequently,—appealing, indeed, to an unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing. \nEmily Dickinson scrutinized everything with clear-eyed frankness. Every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the sombre facts of death and burial, and the \nunknown life beyond. She touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power; but she is never by any chance frivolous or trivial. And while, as one critic has said, she may exhibit toward God \"an Emersonian self-possession,\" it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced as it is rare. \nShe had tried society and the world, and found them lacking. She was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no love-disappointment. Her life was the normal blossoming \nof a nature introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist in pretence. \nStorm, wind, the wild March sky, sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted human friends, were sufficient companionship. \nThe coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through \"the altered air,\" an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy, she lived in its presence. \nMABEL LOOMIS TODD.\n\nAMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS,\n\nAugust, 1891.\n\nMy nosegays are for captives;\nDim, long-expectant eyes,\nFingers denied the plucking,\nPatient till paradise,\n\nTo such, if they should whisper\nOf morning and the moor,\nThey bear no other errand,\nAnd I, no other prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI. LIFE.\n\n\nI'm nobody! Who are you?\nAre you nobody, too?\nThen there 's a pair of us — don't tell!\nThey 'd banish us, you know.\n\nHow dreary to be somebody!\nHow public, like a frog\nTo tell your name the livelong day\nTo an admiring bog!\n\n\nI bring an unaccustomed wine\nTo lips long parching, next to mine,\nAnd summon them to drink.\n\nCrackling with fever, they essay;\nI turn my brimming eyes away,\nAnd come next hour to look.\n\nThe hands still hug the tardy glass;\nThe lips I would have cooled, alas!\nAre so superfluous cold,\n\nI would as soon attempt to warm\nThe bosoms where the frost has lain\nAges beneath the mould.\n\nSome other thirsty there may be\nTo whom this would have pointed me\nHad it remained to speak.\n\nAnd so I always bear the cup\nIf, haply, mine may be the drop\nSome pilgrim thirst to slake, —\n\nIf, haply, any say to me,\n\"Unto the little, unto me,\"\nWhen I at last awake.\n\n\nThe nearest dream recedes, unrealized.\nThe heaven we chase\nLike the June bee\nBefore the school-boy\nInvites the race;\nStoops to an easy clover —\nDips — evades — teases — deploys;\nThen to the royal clouds\nLifts his light pinnace\nHeedless of the boy\nStaring, bewildered, at the mocking sky.\n\nHomesick for steadfast honey,\nAh! the bee flies not\nThat brews that rare variety.\n\n\nWe play at paste,\nTill qualified for pearl,\nThen drop the paste,\nAnd deem ourself a fool.\nThe shapes, though, were similar,\nAnd our new hands\nLearned gem-tactics\nPractising sands.\n\n\nI found the phrase to every thought\nI ever had, but one;\nAnd that defies me, — as a hand\nDid try to chalk the sun\n\nTo races nurtured in the dark; —\nHow would your own begin?\nCan blaze be done in cochineal,\nOr noon in mazarin?\n\n\nHOPE.\n\nHope is the thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul,\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\nAnd never stops at all,\n\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little bird\nThat kept so many warm.\n\nI 've heard it in the chillest land,\nAnd on the strangest sea;\nYet, never, in extremity,\nIt asked a crumb of me.\n\n\nTHE WHITE HEAT.\n\nDare you see a soul at the white heat?\nThen crouch within the door.\nRed is the fire's common tint;\nBut when the vivid ore\n\nHas sated flame's conditions,\nIts quivering substance plays\nWithout a color but the light\nOf unanointed blaze.\n\nLeast village boasts its blacksmith,\nWhose anvil's even din\nStands symbol for the finer forge\nThat soundless tugs within,\n\nRefining these impatient ores\nWith hammer and with blaze,\nUntil the designated light\nRepudiate the forge.\n\n\nTRIUMPHANT.\n\nWho never lost, are unprepared\nA coronet to find;\nWho never thirsted, flagons\nAnd cooling tamarind.\n\nWho never climbed the weary league —\nCan such a foot explore\nThe purple territories\nOn Pizarro's shore?\n\nHow many legions overcome?\nThe emperor will say.\nHow many colors taken\nOn Revolution Day?\n\nHow many bullets bearest?\nThe royal scar hast thou?\nAngels, write \"Promoted\"\nOn this soldier's brow!\n\n\nTHE TEST.\n\nI can wade grief,\nWhole pools of it, —\nI 'm used to that.\nBut the least push of joy\nBreaks up my feet,\nAnd I tip — drunken.\nLet no pebble smile,\n'T was the new liquor, —\nThat was all!\n\nPower is only pain,\nStranded, through discipline,\nTill weights will hang.\nGive balm to giants,\nAnd they 'll wilt, like men.\nGive Himmaleh, —\nThey 'll carry him!\n\n\nESCAPE.\n\nI never hear the word \"escape\"\nWithout a quicker blood,\nA sudden expectation,\nA flying attitude.\n\nI never hear of prisons broad\nBy soldiers battered down,\nBut I tug childish at my bars, —\nOnly to fail again!\n\n\n\nCOMPENSATION.\n\nFor each ecstatic instant\nWe must an anguish pay\nIn keen and quivering ratio\nTo the ecstasy.\n\nFor each beloved hour\nSharp pittances of years,\nBitter contested farthings\nAnd coffers heaped with tears.\n\n\nTHE MARTYRS.\n\nThrough the straight pass of suffering\nThe martyrs even trod,\nTheir feet upon temptation,\nTheir faces upon God.\n\nA stately, shriven company;\nConvulsion playing round,\nHarmless as streaks of meteor\nUpon a planet's bound.\n\nTheir faith the everlasting troth;\nTheir expectation fair;\nThe needle to the north degree\nWades so, through polar air.\n\n\nA PRAYER.\n\nI meant to have but modest needs,\nSuch as content, and heaven;\nWithin my income these could lie,\nAnd life and I keep even.\n\nBut since the last included both,\nIt would suffice my prayer\nBut just for one to stipulate,\nAnd grace would grant the pair.\n\nAnd so, upon this wise I prayed, —\nGreat Spirit, give to me\nA heaven not so large as yours,\nBut large enough for me.\n\nA smile suffused Jehovah's face;\nThe cherubim withdrew;\nGrave saints stole out to look at me,\nAnd showed their dimples, too.\n\nI left the place with all my might, —\nMy prayer away I threw;\nThe quiet ages picked it up,\nAnd Judgment twinkled, too,\n\nThat one so honest be extant\nAs take the tale for true\nThat \"Whatsoever you shall ask,\nItself be given you.\"\n\nBut I, grown shrewder, scan the skies\nWith a suspicious air, —\nAs children, swindled for the first,\nAll swindlers be, infer.\n\n\nThe thought beneath so slight a film\nIs more distinctly seen, —\nAs laces just reveal the surge,\nOr mists the Apennine.\n\n\nThe soul unto itself\nIs an imperial friend, —\nOr the most agonizing spy\nAn enemy could send.\n\nSecure against its own,\nNo treason it can fear;\nItself its sovereign, of itself\nThe soul should stand in awe.\n\n\nSurgeons must be very careful\nWhen they take the knife!\nUnderneath their fine incisions\nStirs the culprit, — Life!\n\n\nTHE RAILWAY TRAIN.\n\nI like to see it lap the miles,\nAnd lick the valleys up,\nAnd stop to feed itself at tanks;\nAnd then, prodigious, step\n\nAround a pile of mountains,\nAnd, supercilious, peer\nIn shanties by the sides of roads;\nAnd then a quarry pare\n\nTo fit its sides, and crawl between,\nComplaining all the while\nIn horrid, hooting stanza;\nThen chase itself down hill\n\nAnd neigh like Boanerges;\nThen, punctual as a star,\nStop — docile and omnipotent —\nAt its own stable door.\n\n\nTHE SHOW.\n\nThe show is not the show,\nBut they that go.\nMenagerie to me\nMy neighbor be.\nFair play —\nBoth went to see.\n\n\nDelight becomes pictorial\nWhen viewed through pain, —\nMore fair, because impossible\nThat any gain.\n\nThe mountain at a given distance\nIn amber lies;\nApproached, the amber flits a little, —\nAnd that 's the skies!\n\n\nA thought went up my mind to-day\nThat I have had before,\nBut did not finish, — some way back,\nI could not fix the year,\n\nNor where it went, nor why it came\nThe second time to me,\nNor definitely what it was,\nHave I the art to say.\n\nBut somewhere in my soul, I know\nI 've met the thing before;\nIt just reminded me — 't was all —\nAnd came my way no more.\n\n\nIs Heaven a physician?\nThey say that He can heal;\nBut medicine posthumous\nIs unavailable.\n\nIs Heaven an exchequer?\nThey speak of what we owe;\nBut that negotiation\nI 'm not a party to.\n\n\nTHE RETURN.\n\nThough I get home how late, how late!\nSo I get home, 't will compensate.\nBetter will be the ecstasy\nThat they have done expecting me,\nWhen, night descending, dumb and dark,\nThey hear my unexpected knock.\nTransporting must the moment be,\nBrewed from decades of agony!\n\nTo think just how the fire will burn,\nJust how long-cheated eyes will turn\nTo wonder what myself will say,\nAnd what itself will say to me,\nBeguiles the centuries of way!\n\n\nA poor torn heart, a tattered heart,\nThat sat it down to rest,\nNor noticed that the ebbing day\nFlowed silver to the west,\nNor noticed night did soft descend\nNor constellation burn,\nIntent upon the vision\nOf latitudes unknown.\n\nThe angels, happening that way,\nThis dusty heart espied;\nTenderly took it up from toil\nAnd carried it to God.\nThere, — sandals for the barefoot;\nThere, — gathered from the gales,\nDo the blue havens by the hand\nLead the wandering sails.\n\n\nTOO MUCH.\n\nI should have been too glad, I see,\nToo lifted for the scant degree\nOf life's penurious round;\nMy little circuit would have shamed\nThis new circumference, have blamed\nThe homelier time behind.\n\nI should have been too saved, I see,\nToo rescued; fear too dim to me\nThat I could spell the prayer\nI knew so perfect yesterday, —\nThat scalding one, \"Sabachthani,\"\nRecited fluent here.\n\nEarth would have been too much, I see,\nAnd heaven not enough for me;\nI should have had the joy\nWithout the fear to justify, —\nThe palm without the Calvary;\nSo, Saviour, crucify.\n\nDefeat whets victory, they say;\nThe reefs in old Gethsemane\nEndear the shore beyond.\n'T is beggars banquets best define;\n'T is thirsting vitalizes wine, —\nFaith faints to understand.\n\n\nSHIPWRECK.\n\nIt tossed and tossed, —\nA little brig I knew, —\nO'ertook by blast,\nIt spun and spun,\nAnd groped delirious, for morn.\n\nIt slipped and slipped,\nAs one that drunken stepped;\nIts white foot tripped,\nThen dropped from sight.\n\nAh, brig, good-night\nTo crew and you;\nThe ocean's heart too smooth, too blue,\nTo break for you.\n\n\nVictory comes late,\nAnd is held low to freezing lips\nToo rapt with frost\nTo take it.\nHow sweet it would have tasted,\nJust a drop!\nWas God so economical?\nHis table 's spread too high for us\nUnless we dine on tip-toe.\nCrumbs fit such little mouths,\nCherries suit robins;\nThe eagle's golden breakfast\nStrangles them.\nGod keeps his oath to sparrows,\nWho of little love\nKnow how to starve!\n\n\nENOUGH.\n\nGod gave a loaf to every bird,\nBut just a crumb to me;\nI dare not eat it, though I starve, —\nMy poignant luxury\nTo own it, touch it, prove the feat\nThat made the pellet mine, —\nToo happy in my sparrow chance\nFor ampler coveting.\n\nIt might be famine all around,\nI could not miss an ear,\nSuch plenty smiles upon my board,\nMy garner shows so fair.\nI wonder how the rich may feel, —\nAn Indiaman — an Earl?\nI deem that I with but a crumb\nAm sovereign of them all.\n\n\nExperiment to me\nIs every one I meet.\nIf it contain a kernel?\nThe figure of a nut\n\nPresents upon a tree,\nEqually plausibly;\nBut meat within is requisite,\nTo squirrels and to me.\n\n\nMY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.\n\nMy country need not change her gown,\nHer triple suit as sweet\nAs when 't was cut at Lexington,\nAnd first pronounced \"a fit.\"\n\nGreat Britain disapproves \"the stars;\"\nDisparagement discreet, —\nThere 's something in their attitude\nThat taunts her bayonet.\n\n\nFaith is a fine invention\nFor gentlemen who see;\nBut microscopes are prudent\nIn an emergency!\n\n\nExcept the heaven had come so near,\nSo seemed to choose my door,\nThe distance would not haunt me so;\nI had not hoped before.\n\nBut just to hear the grace depart\nI never thought to see,\nAfflicts me with a double loss;\n'T is lost, and lost to me.\n\n\nPortraits are to daily faces\nAs an evening west\nTo a fine, pedantic sunshine\nIn a satin vest.\n\n\nTHE DUEL.\n\nI took my power in my hand.\nAnd went against the world;\n'T was not so much as David had,\nBut I was twice as bold.\n\nI aimed my pebble, but myself\nWas all the one that fell.\nWas it Goliath was too large,\nOr only I too small?\n\n\nA shady friend for torrid days\nIs easier to find\nThan one of higher temperature\nFor frigid hour of mind.\n\nThe vane a little to the east\nScares muslin souls away;\nIf broadcloth breasts are firmer\nThan those of organdy,\n\nWho is to blame? The weaver?\nAh! the bewildering thread!\nThe tapestries of paradise\nSo notelessly are made!\n\n\nTHE GOAL.\n\nEach life converges to some centre\nExpressed or still;\nExists in every human nature\nA goal,\n\nAdmitted scarcely to itself, it may be,\nToo fair\nFor credibility's temerity\nTo dare.\n\nAdored with caution, as a brittle heaven,\nTo reach\nWere hopeless as the rainbow's raiment\nTo touch,\n\nYet persevered toward, surer for the distance;\nHow high\nUnto the saints' slow diligence\nThe sky!\n\nUngained, it may be, by a life's low venture,\nBut then,\nEternity enables the endeavoring\nAgain.\n\n\nSIGHT.\n\nBefore I got my eye put out,\nI liked as well to see\nAs other creatures that have eyes,\nAnd know no other way.\n\nBut were it told to me, to-day,\nThat I might have the sky\nFor mine, I tell you that my heart\nWould split, for size of me.\n\nThe meadows mine, the mountains mine, —\nAll forests, stintless stars,\nAs much of noon as I could take\nBetween my finite eyes.\n\nThe motions of the dipping birds,\nThe lightning's jointed road,\nFor mine to look at when I liked, —\nThe news would strike me dead!\n\nSo safer, guess, with just my soul\nUpon the window-pane\nWhere other creatures put their eyes,\nIncautious of the sun.\n\n\nTalk with prudence to a beggar\nOf 'Potosi' and the mines!\nReverently to the hungry\nOf your viands and your wines!\n\nCautious, hint to any captive\nYou have passed enfranchised feet!\nAnecdotes of air in dungeons\nHave sometimes proved deadly sweet!\n\n\nTHE PREACHER.\n\nHe preached upon \"breadth\" till it argued him narrow, —\nThe broad are too broad to define;\nAnd of \"truth\" until it proclaimed him a liar, —\nThe truth never flaunted a sign.\n\nSimplicity fled from his counterfeit presence\nAs gold the pyrites would shun.\nWhat confusion would cover the innocent Jesus\nTo meet so enabled a man!\n\n\nGood night! which put the candle out?\nA jealous zephyr, not a doubt.\nAh! friend, you little knew\nHow long at that celestial wick\nThe angels labored diligent;\nExtinguished, now, for you!\n\nIt might have been the lighthouse spark\nSome sailor, rowing in the dark,\nHad importuned to see!\nIt might have been the waning lamp\nThat lit the drummer from the camp\nTo purer reveille!\n\n\nWhen I hoped I feared,\nSince I hoped I dared;\nEverywhere alone\nAs a church remain;\nSpectre cannot harm,\nSerpent cannot charm;\nHe deposes doom,\nWho hath suffered him.\n\n\nDEED.\n\nA deed knocks first at thought,\nAnd then it knocks at will.\nThat is the manufacturing spot,\nAnd will at home and well.\n\nIt then goes out an act,\nOr is entombed so still\nThat only to the ear of God\nIts doom is audible.\n\n\nTIME'S LESSON.\n\nMine enemy is growing old, —\nI have at last revenge.\nThe palate of the hate departs;\nIf any would avenge, —\n\nLet him be quick, the viand flits,\nIt is a faded meat.\nAnger as soon as fed is dead;\n'T is starving makes it fat.\n\n\nREMORSE.\n\nRemorse is memory awake,\nHer companies astir, —\nA presence of departed acts\nAt window and at door.\n\nIt's past set down before the soul,\nAnd lighted with a match,\nPerusal to facilitate\nOf its condensed despatch.\n\nRemorse is cureless, — the disease\nNot even God can heal;\nFor 't is his institution, —\nThe complement of hell.\n\n\nTHE SHELTER.\n\nThe body grows outside, —\nThe more convenient way, —\nThat if the spirit like to hide,\nIts temple stands alway\n\nAjar, secure, inviting;\nIt never did betray\nThe soul that asked its shelter\nIn timid honesty.\n\n\nUndue significance a starving man attaches\nTo food\nFar off; he sighs, and therefore hopeless,\nAnd therefore good.\n\nPartaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us\nThat spices fly\nIn the receipt. It was the distance\nWas savory.\n\n\nHeart not so heavy as mine,\nWending late home,\nAs it passed my window\nWhistled itself a tune, —\n\nA careless snatch, a ballad,\nA ditty of the street;\nYet to my irritated ear\nAn anodyne so sweet,\n\nIt was as if a bobolink,\nSauntering this way,\nCarolled and mused and carolled,\nThen bubbled slow away.\n\nIt was as if a chirping brook\nUpon a toilsome way\nSet bleeding feet to minuets\nWithout the knowing why.\n\nTo-morrow, night will come again,\nWeary, perhaps, and sore.\nAh, bugle, by my window,\nI pray you stroll once more!\n\n\nI many times thought peace had come,\nWhen peace was far away;\nAs wrecked men deem they sight the land\nAt centre of the sea,\n\nAnd struggle slacker, but to prove,\nAs hopelessly as I,\nHow many the fictitious shores\nBefore the harbor lie.\n\n\nUnto my books so good to turn\nFar ends of tired days;\nIt half endears the abstinence,\nAnd pain is missed in praise.\n\nAs flavors cheer retarded guests\nWith banquetings to be,\nSo spices stimulate the time\nTill my small library.\n\nIt may be wilderness without,\nFar feet of failing men,\nBut holiday excludes the night,\nAnd it is bells within.\n\nI thank these kinsmen of the shelf;\nTheir countenances bland\nEnamour in prospective,\nAnd satisfy, obtained.\n\n\nThis merit hath the worst, —\nIt cannot be again.\nWhen Fate hath taunted last\nAnd thrown her furthest stone,\n\nThe maimed may pause and breathe,\nAnd glance securely round.\nThe deer invites no longer\nThan it eludes the hound.\n\n\nHUNGER.\n\nI had been hungry all the years;\nMy noon had come, to dine;\nI, trembling, drew the table near,\nAnd touched the curious wine.\n\n'T was this on tables I had seen,\nWhen turning, hungry, lone,\nI looked in windows, for the wealth\nI could not hope to own.\n\nI did not know the ample bread,\n'T was so unlike the crumb\nThe birds and I had often shared\nIn Nature's dining-room.\n\nThe plenty hurt me, 't was so new, —\nMyself felt ill and odd,\nAs berry of a mountain bush\nTransplanted to the road.\n\nNor was I hungry; so I found\nThat hunger was a way\nOf persons outside windows,\nThe entering takes away.\n\n\nI gained it so,\nBy climbing slow,\nBy catching at the twigs that grow\nBetween the bliss and me.\nIt hung so high,\nAs well the sky\nAttempt by strategy.\n\n\nI said I gained it, —\nThis was all.\nLook, how I clutch it,\nLest it fall,\nAnd I a pauper go;\nUnfitted by an instant's grace\nFor the contented beggar's face\nI wore an hour ago.\n\n\nTo learn the transport by the pain,\nAs blind men learn the sun;\nTo die of thirst, suspecting\nThat brooks in meadows run;\n\nTo stay the homesick, homesick feet\nUpon a foreign shore\nHaunted by native lands, the while,\nAnd blue, beloved air —\n\nThis is the sovereign anguish,\nThis, the signal woe!\nThese are the patient laureates\nWhose voices, trained below,\n\nAscend in ceaseless carol,\nInaudible, indeed,\nTo us, the duller scholars\nOf the mysterious bard!\n\n\nRETURNING.\n\nI years had been from home,\nAnd now, before the door,\nI dared not open, lest a face\nI never saw before\n\nStare vacant into mine\nAnd ask my business there.\nMy business, — just a life I left,\nWas such still dwelling there?\n\nI fumbled at my nerve,\nI scanned the windows near;\nThe silence like an ocean rolled,\nAnd broke against my ear.\n\nI laughed a wooden laugh\nThat I could fear a door,\nWho danger and the dead had faced,\nBut never quaked before.\n\nI fitted to the latch\nMy hand, with trembling care,\nLest back the awful door should spring,\nAnd leave me standing there.\n\nI moved my fingers off\nAs cautiously as glass,\nAnd held my ears, and like a thief\nFled gasping from the house.\n\n\nPRAYER.\n\nPrayer is the little implement\nThrough which men reach\nWhere presence is denied them.\nThey fling their speech\n\nBy means of it in God's ear;\nIf then He hear,\nThis sums the apparatus\nComprised in prayer.\n\n\nI know that he exists\nSomewhere, in silence.\nHe has hid his rare life\nFrom our gross eyes.\n\n'T is an instant's play,\n'T is a fond ambush,\nJust to make bliss\nEarn her own surprise!\n\nBut should the play\nProve piercing earnest,\nShould the glee glaze\nIn death's stiff stare,\n\nWould not the fun\nLook too expensive?\nWould not the jest\nHave crawled too far?\n\n\nMELODIES UNHEARD.\n\nMusicians wrestle everywhere:\nAll day, among the crowded air,\nI hear the silver strife;\nAnd — waking long before the dawn —\nSuch transport breaks upon the town\nI think it that \"new life!\"\n\nIt is not bird, it has no nest;\nNor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,\nNor tambourine, nor man;\nIt is not hymn from pulpit read, —\nThe morning stars the treble led\nOn time's first afternoon!\n\nSome say it is the spheres at play!\nSome say that bright majority\nOf vanished dames and men!\nSome think it service in the place\nWhere we, with late, celestial face,\nPlease God, shall ascertain!\n\n\nCALLED BACK.\n\nJust lost when I was saved!\nJust felt the world go by!\nJust girt me for the onset with eternity,\nWhen breath blew back,\nAnd on the other side\nI heard recede the disappointed tide!\n\nTherefore, as one returned, I feel,\nOdd secrets of the line to tell!\nSome sailor, skirting foreign shores,\nSome pale reporter from the awful doors\nBefore the seal!\n\nNext time, to stay!\nNext time, the things to see\nBy ear unheard,\nUnscrutinized by eye.\n\nNext time, to tarry,\nWhile the ages steal, —\nSlow tramp the centuries,\nAnd the cycles wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. LOVE.\n\n\nCHOICE.\n\nOf all the souls that stand create\nI have elected one.\nWhen sense from spirit files away,\nAnd subterfuge is done;\n\nWhen that which is and that which was\nApart, intrinsic, stand,\nAnd this brief tragedy of flesh\nIs shifted like a sand;\n\nWhen figures show their royal front\nAnd mists are carved away, —\nBehold the atom I preferred\nTo all the lists of clay!\n\n\nI have no life but this,\nTo lead it here;\nNor any death, but lest\nDispelled from there;\n\nNor tie to earths to come,\nNor action new,\nExcept through this extent,\nThe realm of you.\n\n\nYour riches taught me poverty.\nMyself a millionnaire\nIn little wealths, — as girls could boast, —\nTill broad as Buenos Ayre,\n\nYou drifted your dominions\nA different Peru;\nAnd I esteemed all poverty,\nFor life's estate with you.\n\nOf mines I little know, myself,\nBut just the names of gems, —\nThe colors of the commonest;\nAnd scarce of diadems\n\nSo much that, did I meet the queen,\nHer glory I should know:\nBut this must be a different wealth,\nTo miss it beggars so.\n\nI 'm sure 't is India all day\nTo those who look on you\nWithout a stint, without a blame, —\nMight I but be the Jew!\n\nI 'm sure it is Golconda,\nBeyond my power to deem, —\nTo have a smile for mine each day,\nHow better than a gem!\n\nAt least, it solaces to know\nThat there exists a gold,\nAlthough I prove it just in time\nIts distance to behold!\n\nIt 's far, far treasure to surmise,\nAnd estimate the pearl\nThat slipped my simple fingers through\nWhile just a girl at school!\n\n\nTHE CONTRACT.\n\nI gave myself to him,\nAnd took himself for pay.\nThe solemn contract of a life\nWas ratified this way.\n\nThe wealth might disappoint,\nMyself a poorer prove\nThan this great purchaser suspect,\nThe daily own of Love\n\nDepreciate the vision;\nBut, till the merchant buy,\nStill fable, in the isles of spice,\nThe subtle cargoes lie.\n\nAt least, 't is mutual risk, —\nSome found it mutual gain;\nSweet debt of Life, — each night to owe,\nInsolvent, every noon.\n\n\nTHE LETTER.\n\n\"Going to him! Happy letter! Tell him —\nTell him the page I didn't write;\nTell him I only said the syntax,\nAnd left the verb and the pronoun out.\nTell him just how the fingers hurried,\nThen how they waded, slow, slow, slow;\nAnd then you wished you had eyes in your pages,\nSo you could see what moved them so.\n\n\"Tell him it wasn't a practised writer,\nYou guessed, from the way the sentence toiled;\nYou could hear the bodice tug, behind you,\nAs if it held but the might of a child;\nYou almost pitied it, you, it worked so.\nTell him — No, you may quibble there,\nFor it would split his heart to know it,\nAnd then you and I were silenter.\n\n\"Tell him night finished before we finished,\nAnd the old clock kept neighing 'day!'\nAnd you got sleepy and begged to be ended —\nWhat could it hinder so, to say?\nTell him just how she sealed you, cautious,\nBut if he ask where you are hid\nUntil to-morrow, — happy letter!\nGesture, coquette, and shake your head!\"\n\n\nThe way I read a letter 's this:\n'T is first I lock the door,\nAnd push it with my fingers next,\nFor transport it be sure.\n\nAnd then I go the furthest off\nTo counteract a knock;\nThen draw my little letter forth\nAnd softly pick its lock.\n\nThen, glancing narrow at the wall,\nAnd narrow at the floor,\nFor firm conviction of a mouse\nNot exorcised before,\n\nPeruse how infinite I am\nTo — no one that you know!\nAnd sigh for lack of heaven, — but not\nThe heaven the creeds bestow.\n\n\nWild nights! Wild nights!\nWere I with thee,\nWild nights should be\nOur luxury!\n\nFutile the winds\nTo a heart in port, —\nDone with the compass,\nDone with the chart.\n\nRowing in Eden!\nAh! the sea!\nMight I but moor\nTo-night in thee!\n\n\nAT HOME.\n\nThe night was wide, and furnished scant\nWith but a single star,\nThat often as a cloud it met\nBlew out itself for fear.\n\nThe wind pursued the little bush,\nAnd drove away the leaves\nNovember left; then clambered up\nAnd fretted in the eaves.\n\nNo squirrel went abroad;\nA dog's belated feet\nLike intermittent plush were heard\nAdown the empty street.\n\nTo feel if blinds be fast,\nAnd closer to the fire\nHer little rocking-chair to draw,\nAnd shiver for the poor,\n\nThe housewife's gentle task.\n\"How pleasanter,\" said she\nUnto the sofa opposite,\n\"The sleet than May — no thee!\"\n\n\nPOSSESSION.\n\nDid the harebell loose her girdle\nTo the lover bee,\nWould the bee the harebell hallow\nMuch as formerly?\n\nDid the paradise, persuaded,\nYield her moat of pearl,\nWould the Eden be an Eden,\nOr the earl an earl?\n\n\nA charm invests a face\nImperfectly beheld, —\nThe lady dare not lift her veil\nFor fear it be dispelled.\n\nBut peers beyond her mesh,\nAnd wishes, and denies, —\nLest interview annul a want\nThat image satisfies.\n\n\nTHE LOVERS.\n\nThe rose did caper on her cheek,\nHer bodice rose and fell,\nHer pretty speech, like drunken men,\nDid stagger pitiful.\n\nHer fingers fumbled at her work, —\nHer needle would not go;\nWhat ailed so smart a little maid\nIt puzzled me to know,\n\nTill opposite I spied a cheek\nThat bore another rose;\nJust opposite, another speech\nThat like the drunkard goes;\n\nA vest that, like the bodice, danced\nTo the immortal tune, —\nTill those two troubled little clocks\nTicked softly into one.\n\n\nIn lands I never saw, they say,\nImmortal Alps look down,\nWhose bonnets touch the firmament,\nWhose sandals touch the town, —\n\nMeek at whose everlasting feet\nA myriad daisies play.\nWhich, sir, are you, and which am I,\nUpon an August day?\n\n\nThe moon is distant from the sea,\nAnd yet with amber hands\nShe leads him, docile as a boy,\nAlong appointed sands.\n\nHe never misses a degree;\nObedient to her eye,\nHe comes just so far toward the town,\nJust so far goes away.\n\nOh, Signor, thine the amber hand,\nAnd mine the distant sea, —\nObedient to the least command\nThine eyes impose on me.\n\n\nHe put the belt around my life, —\nI heard the buckle snap,\nAnd turned away, imperial,\nMy lifetime folding up\nDeliberate, as a duke would do\nA kingdom's title-deed, —\nHenceforth a dedicated sort,\nA member of the cloud.\n\nYet not too far to come at call,\nAnd do the little toils\nThat make the circuit of the rest,\nAnd deal occasional smiles\nTo lives that stoop to notice mine\nAnd kindly ask it in, —\nWhose invitation, knew you not\nFor whom I must decline?\n\n\nTHE LOST JEWEL.\n\nI held a jewel in my fingers\nAnd went to sleep.\nThe day was warm, and winds were prosy;\nI said: \"'T will keep.\"\n\nI woke and chid my honest fingers, —\nThe gem was gone;\nAnd now an amethyst remembrance\nIs all I own.\n\n\nWhat if I say I shall not wait?\nWhat if I burst the fleshly gate\nAnd pass, escaped, to thee?\nWhat if I file this mortal off,\nSee where it hurt me, — that 's enough, —\nAnd wade in liberty?\n\nThey cannot take us any more, —\nDungeons may call, and guns implore;\nUnmeaning now, to me,\nAs laughter was an hour ago,\nOr laces, or a travelling show,\nOr who died yesterday!\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. NATURE.\n\n\nMOTHER NATURE.\n\nNature, the gentlest mother,\nImpatient of no child,\nThe feeblest or the waywardest, —\nHer admonition mild\n\nIn forest and the hill\nBy traveller is heard,\nRestraining rampant squirrel\nOr too impetuous bird.\n\nHow fair her conversation,\nA summer afternoon, —\nHer household, her assembly;\nAnd when the sun goes down\n\nHer voice among the aisles\nIncites the timid prayer\nOf the minutest cricket,\nThe most unworthy flower.\n\nWhen all the children sleep\nShe turns as long away\nAs will suffice to light her lamps;\nThen, bending from the sky\n\nWith infinite affection\nAnd infiniter care,\nHer golden finger on her lip,\nWills silence everywhere.\n\n\nOUT OF THE MORNING.\n\nWill there really be a morning?\nIs there such a thing as day?\nCould I see it from the mountains\nIf I were as tall as they?\n\nHas it feet like water-lilies?\nHas it feathers like a bird?\nIs it brought from famous countries\nOf which I have never heard?\n\nOh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!\nOh, some wise man from the skies!\nPlease to tell a little pilgrim\nWhere the place called morning lies!\n\n\nAt half-past three a single bird\nUnto a silent sky\nPropounded but a single term\nOf cautious melody.\n\nAt half-past four, experiment\nHad subjugated test,\nAnd lo! her silver principle\nSupplanted all the rest.\n\nAt half-past seven, element\nNor implement was seen,\nAnd place was where the presence was,\nCircumference between.\n\n\nDAY'S PARLOR.\n\nThe day came slow, till five o'clock,\nThen sprang before the hills\nLike hindered rubies, or the light\nA sudden musket spills.\n\nThe purple could not keep the east,\nThe sunrise shook from fold,\nLike breadths of topaz, packed a night,\nThe lady just unrolled.\n\nThe happy winds their timbrels took;\nThe birds, in docile rows,\nArranged themselves around their prince\n(The wind is prince of those).\n\nThe orchard sparkled like a Jew, —\nHow mighty 't was, to stay\nA guest in this stupendous place,\nThe parlor of the day!\n\n\nTHE SUN'S WOOING.\n\nThe sun just touched the morning;\nThe morning, happy thing,\nSupposed that he had come to dwell,\nAnd life would be all spring.\n\nShe felt herself supremer, —\nA raised, ethereal thing;\nHenceforth for her what holiday!\nMeanwhile, her wheeling king\n\nTrailed slow along the orchards\nHis haughty, spangled hems,\nLeaving a new necessity, —\nThe want of diadems!\n\nThe morning fluttered, staggered,\nFelt feebly for her crown, —\nHer unanointed forehead\nHenceforth her only one.\n\n\n\nTHE ROBIN.\n\nThe robin is the one\nThat interrupts the morn\nWith hurried, few, express reports\nWhen March is scarcely on.\n\nThe robin is the one\nThat overflows the noon\nWith her cherubic quantity,\nAn April but begun.\n\nThe robin is the one\nThat speechless from her nest\nSubmits that home and certainty\nAnd sanctity are best.\n\n\nTHE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.\n\nFrom cocoon forth a butterfly\nAs lady from her door\nEmerged — a summer afternoon —\nRepairing everywhere,\n\nWithout design, that I could trace,\nExcept to stray abroad\nOn miscellaneous enterprise\nThe clovers understood.\n\nHer pretty parasol was seen\nContracting in a field\nWhere men made hay, then struggling hard\nWith an opposing cloud,\n\nWhere parties, phantom as herself,\nTo Nowhere seemed to go\nIn purposeless circumference,\nAs 't were a tropic show.\n\nAnd notwithstanding bee that worked,\nAnd flower that zealous blew,\nThis audience of idleness\nDisdained them, from the sky,\n\nTill sundown crept, a steady tide,\nAnd men that made the hay,\nAnd afternoon, and butterfly,\nExtinguished in its sea.\n\n\nTHE BLUEBIRD.\n\nBefore you thought of spring,\nExcept as a surmise,\nYou see, God bless his suddenness,\nA fellow in the skies\nOf independent hues,\nA little weather-worn,\nInspiriting habiliments\nOf indigo and brown.\n\nWith specimens of song,\nAs if for you to choose,\nDiscretion in the interval,\nWith gay delays he goes\nTo some superior tree\nWithout a single leaf,\nAnd shouts for joy to nobody\nBut his seraphic self!\n\n\nAPRIL.\n\nAn altered look about the hills;\nA Tyrian light the village fills;\nA wider sunrise in the dawn;\nA deeper twilight on the lawn;\nA print of a vermilion foot;\nA purple finger on the slope;\nA flippant fly upon the pane;\nA spider at his trade again;\nAn added strut in chanticleer;\nA flower expected everywhere;\nAn axe shrill singing in the woods;\nFern-odors on untravelled roads, —\nAll this, and more I cannot tell,\nA furtive look you know as well,\nAnd Nicodemus' mystery\nReceives its annual reply.\n\n\nTHE SLEEPING FLOWERS.\n\n\"Whose are the little beds,\" I asked,\n\"Which in the valleys lie?\"\nSome shook their heads, and others smiled,\nAnd no one made reply.\n\n\"Perhaps they did not hear,\" I said;\n\"I will inquire again.\nWhose are the beds, the tiny beds\nSo thick upon the plain?\"\n\n\"'T is daisy in the shortest;\nA little farther on,\nNearest the door to wake the first,\nLittle leontodon.\n\n\"'T is iris, sir, and aster,\nAnemone and bell,\nBatschia in the blanket red,\nAnd chubby daffodil.\"\n\nMeanwhile at many cradles\nHer busy foot she plied,\nHumming the quaintest lullaby\nThat ever rocked a child.\n\n\"Hush! Epigea wakens! —\nThe crocus stirs her lids,\nRhodora's cheek is crimson, —\nShe's dreaming of the woods.\"\n\nThen, turning from them, reverent,\n\"Their bed-time 't is,\" she said;\n\"The bumble-bees will wake them\nWhen April woods are red.\"\n\n\nMY ROSE.\n\nPigmy seraphs gone astray,\nVelvet people from Vevay,\nBelles from some lost summer day,\nBees' exclusive coterie.\nParis could not lay the fold\nBelted down with emerald;\nVenice could not show a cheek\nOf a tint so lustrous meek.\nNever such an ambuscade\nAs of brier and leaf displayed\nFor my little damask maid.\nI had rather wear her grace\nThan an earl's distinguished face;\nI had rather dwell like her\nThan be Duke of Exeter\nRoyalty enough for me\nTo subdue the bumble-bee!\n\n\nTHE ORIOLE'S SECRET.\n\nTo hear an oriole sing\nMay be a common thing,\nOr only a divine.\n\nIt is not of the bird\nWho sings the same, unheard,\nAs unto crowd.\n\nThe fashion of the ear\nAttireth that it hear\nIn dun or fair.\n\nSo whether it be rune,\nOr whether it be none,\nIs of within;\n\nThe \"tune is in the tree,\"\nThe sceptic showeth me;\n\"No, sir! In thee!\"\n\n\nTHE ORIOLE.\n\nOne of the ones that Midas touched,\nWho failed to touch us all,\nWas that confiding prodigal,\nThe blissful oriole.\n\nSo drunk, he disavows it\nWith badinage divine;\nSo dazzling, we mistake him\nFor an alighting mine.\n\nA pleader, a dissembler,\nAn epicure, a thief, —\nBetimes an oratorio,\nAn ecstasy in chief;\n\nThe Jesuit of orchards,\nHe cheats as he enchants\nOf an entire attar\nFor his decamping wants.\n\nThe splendor of a Burmah,\nThe meteor of birds,\nDeparting like a pageant\nOf ballads and of bards.\n\nI never thought that Jason sought\nFor any golden fleece;\nBut then I am a rural man,\nWith thoughts that make for peace.\n\nBut if there were a Jason,\nTradition suffer me\nBehold his lost emolument\nUpon the apple-tree.\n\n\nIN SHADOW.\n\nI dreaded that first robin so,\nBut he is mastered now,\nAnd I 'm accustomed to him grown, —\nHe hurts a little, though.\n\nI thought if I could only live\nTill that first shout got by,\nNot all pianos in the woods\nHad power to mangle me.\n\nI dared not meet the daffodils,\nFor fear their yellow gown\nWould pierce me with a fashion\nSo foreign to my own.\n\nI wished the grass would hurry,\nSo when 't was time to see,\nHe 'd be too tall, the tallest one\nCould stretch to look at me.\n\nI could not bear the bees should come,\nI wished they 'd stay away\nIn those dim countries where they go:\nWhat word had they for me?\n\nThey 're here, though; not a creature failed,\nNo blossom stayed away\nIn gentle deference to me,\nThe Queen of Calvary.\n\nEach one salutes me as he goes,\nAnd I my childish plumes\nLift, in bereaved acknowledgment\nOf their unthinking drums.\n\n\nTHE HUMMING-BIRD.\n\nA route of evanescence\nWith a revolving wheel;\nA resonance of emerald,\nA rush of cochineal;\nAnd every blossom on the bush\nAdjusts its tumbled head, —\nThe mail from Tunis, probably,\nAn easy morning's ride.\n\n\nSECRETS.\n\nThe skies can't keep their secret!\nThey tell it to the hills —\nThe hills just tell the orchards —\nAnd they the daffodils!\n\nA bird, by chance, that goes that way\nSoft overheard the whole.\nIf I should bribe the little bird,\nWho knows but she would tell?\n\nI think I won't, however,\nIt's finer not to know;\nIf summer were an axiom,\nWhat sorcery had snow?\n\nSo keep your secret, Father!\nI would not, if I could,\nKnow what the sapphire fellows do,\nIn your new-fashioned world!\n\n\nWho robbed the woods,\nThe trusting woods?\nThe unsuspecting trees\nBrought out their burrs and mosses\nHis fantasy to please.\nHe scanned their trinkets, curious,\nHe grasped, he bore away.\nWhat will the solemn hemlock,\nWhat will the fir-tree say?\n\n\nTWO VOYAGERS.\n\nTwo butterflies went out at noon\nAnd waltzed above a stream,\nThen stepped straight through the firmament\nAnd rested on a beam;\n\nAnd then together bore away\nUpon a shining sea, —\nThough never yet, in any port,\nTheir coming mentioned be.\n\nIf spoken by the distant bird,\nIf met in ether sea\nBy frigate or by merchantman,\nReport was not to me.\n\n\nBY THE SEA.\n\nI started early, took my dog,\nAnd visited the sea;\nThe mermaids in the basement\nCame out to look at me,\n\nAnd frigates in the upper floor\nExtended hempen hands,\nPresuming me to be a mouse\nAground, upon the sands.\n\nBut no man moved me till the tide\nWent past my simple shoe,\nAnd past my apron and my belt,\nAnd past my bodice too,\n\nAnd made as he would eat me up\nAs wholly as a dew\nUpon a dandelion's sleeve —\nAnd then I started too.\n\nAnd he — he followed close behind;\nI felt his silver heel\nUpon my ankle, — then my shoes\nWould overflow with pearl.\n\nUntil we met the solid town,\nNo man he seemed to know;\nAnd bowing with a mighty look\nAt me, the sea withdrew.\n\n\nOLD-FASHIONED.\n\nArcturus is his other name, —\nI'd rather call him star!\nIt's so unkind of science\nTo go and interfere!\n\nI pull a flower from the woods, —\nA monster with a glass\nComputes the stamens in a breath,\nAnd has her in a class.\n\nWhereas I took the butterfly\nAforetime in my hat,\nHe sits erect in cabinets,\nThe clover-bells forgot.\n\nWhat once was heaven, is zenith now.\nWhere I proposed to go\nWhen time's brief masquerade was done,\nIs mapped, and charted too!\n\nWhat if the poles should frisk about\nAnd stand upon their heads!\nI hope I 'm ready for the worst,\nWhatever prank betides!\n\nPerhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!\nI hope the children there\nWon't be new-fashioned when I come,\nAnd laugh at me, and stare!\n\nI hope the father in the skies\nWill lift his little girl, —\nOld-fashioned, naughty, everything, —\nOver the stile of pearl!\n\n\nA TEMPEST.\n\nAn awful tempest mashed the air,\nThe clouds were gaunt and few;\nA black, as of a spectre's cloak,\nHid heaven and earth from view.\n\nThe creatures chuckled on the roofs\nAnd whistled in the air,\nAnd shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.\nAnd swung their frenzied hair.\n\nThe morning lit, the birds arose;\nThe monster's faded eyes\nTurned slowly to his native coast,\nAnd peace was Paradise!\n\n\nTHE SEA.\n\nAn everywhere of silver,\nWith ropes of sand\nTo keep it from effacing\nThe track called land.\n\n\nIN THE GARDEN.\n\nA bird came down the walk:\nHe did not know I saw;\nHe bit an angle-worm in halves\nAnd ate the fellow, raw.\n\nAnd then he drank a dew\nFrom a convenient grass,\nAnd then hopped sidewise to the wall\nTo let a beetle pass.\n\nHe glanced with rapid eyes\nThat hurried all abroad, —\nThey looked like frightened beads, I thought;\nHe stirred his velvet head\n\nLike one in danger; cautious,\nI offered him a crumb,\nAnd he unrolled his feathers\nAnd rowed him softer home\n\nThan oars divide the ocean,\nToo silver for a seam,\nOr butterflies, off banks of noon,\nLeap, plashless, as they swim.\n\n\nTHE SNAKE.\n\nA narrow fellow in the grass\nOccasionally rides;\nYou may have met him, — did you not,\nHis notice sudden is.\n\nThe grass divides as with a comb,\nA spotted shaft is seen;\nAnd then it closes at your feet\nAnd opens further on.\n\nHe likes a boggy acre,\nA floor too cool for corn.\nYet when a child, and barefoot,\nI more than once, at morn,\n\nHave passed, I thought, a whip-lash\nUnbraiding in the sun, —\nWhen, stooping to secure it,\nIt wrinkled, and was gone.\n\nSeveral of nature's people\nI know, and they know me;\nI feel for them a transport\nOf cordiality;\n\nBut never met this fellow,\nAttended or alone,\nWithout a tighter breathing,\nAnd zero at the bone.\n\n\nTHE MUSHROOM.\n\nThe mushroom is the elf of plants,\nAt evening it is not;\nAt morning in a truffled hut\nIt stops upon a spot\n\nAs if it tarried always;\nAnd yet its whole career\nIs shorter than a snake's delay,\nAnd fleeter than a tare.\n\n'T is vegetation's juggler,\nThe germ of alibi;\nDoth like a bubble antedate,\nAnd like a bubble hie.\n\nI feel as if the grass were pleased\nTo have it intermit;\nThe surreptitious scion\nOf summer's circumspect.\n\nHad nature any outcast face,\nCould she a son contemn,\nHad nature an Iscariot,\nThat mushroom, — it is him.\n\n\nTHE STORM.\n\nThere came a wind like a bugle;\nIt quivered through the grass,\nAnd a green chill upon the heat\nSo ominous did pass\nWe barred the windows and the doors\nAs from an emerald ghost;\nThe doom's electric moccason\nThat very instant passed.\nOn a strange mob of panting trees,\nAnd fences fled away,\nAnd rivers where the houses ran\nThe living looked that day.\nThe bell within the steeple wild\nThe flying tidings whirled.\nHow much can come\nAnd much can go,\nAnd yet abide the world!\n\n\nTHE SPIDER.\n\nA spider sewed at night\nWithout a light\nUpon an arc of white.\nIf ruff it was of dame\nOr shroud of gnome,\nHimself, himself inform.\nOf immortality\nHis strategy\nWas physiognomy.\n\n\nI know a place where summer strives\nWith such a practised frost,\nShe each year leads her daisies back,\nRecording briefly, \"Lost.\"\n\nBut when the south wind stirs the pools\nAnd struggles in the lanes,\nHer heart misgives her for her vow,\nAnd she pours soft refrains\n\nInto the lap of adamant,\nAnd spices, and the dew,\nThat stiffens quietly to quartz,\nUpon her amber shoe.\n\n\nThe one that could repeat the summer day\nWere greater than itself, though he\nMinutest of mankind might be.\nAnd who could reproduce the sun,\nAt period of going down —\nThe lingering and the stain, I mean —\nWhen Orient has been outgrown,\nAnd Occident becomes unknown,\nHis name remain.\n\n\nTHE WlND'S VISIT.\n\nThe wind tapped like a tired man,\nAnd like a host, \"Come in,\"\nI boldly answered; entered then\nMy residence within\n\nA rapid, footless guest,\nTo offer whom a chair\nWere as impossible as hand\nA sofa to the air.\n\nNo bone had he to bind him,\nHis speech was like the push\nOf numerous humming-birds at once\nFrom a superior bush.\n\nHis countenance a billow,\nHis fingers, if he pass,\nLet go a music, as of tunes\nBlown tremulous in glass.\n\nHe visited, still flitting;\nThen, like a timid man,\nAgain he tapped — 't was flurriedly —\nAnd I became alone.\n\n\nNature rarer uses yellow\nThan another hue;\nSaves she all of that for sunsets, —\nProdigal of blue,\n\nSpending scarlet like a woman,\nYellow she affords\nOnly scantly and selectly,\nLike a lover's words.\n\n\nGOSSIP.\n\nThe leaves, like women, interchange\nSagacious confidence;\nSomewhat of nods, and somewhat of\nPortentous inference,\n\nThe parties in both cases\nEnjoining secrecy, —\nInviolable compact\nTo notoriety.\n\n\nSIMPLICITY.\n\nHow happy is the little stone\nThat rambles in the road alone,\nAnd doesn't care about careers,\nAnd exigencies never fears;\nWhose coat of elemental brown\nA passing universe put on;\nAnd independent as the sun,\nAssociates or glows alone,\nFulfilling absolute decree\nIn casual simplicity.\n\n\nSTORM.\n\nIt sounded as if the streets were running,\nAnd then the streets stood still.\nEclipse was all we could see at the window,\nAnd awe was all we could feel.\n\nBy and by the boldest stole out of his covert,\nTo see if time was there.\nNature was in her beryl apron,\nMixing fresher air.\n\n\nTHE RAT.\n\nThe rat is the concisest tenant.\nHe pays no rent, —\nRepudiates the obligation,\nOn schemes intent.\n\nBalking our wit\nTo sound or circumvent,\nHate cannot harm\nA foe so reticent.\n\nNeither decree\nProhibits him,\nLawful as\nEquilibrium.\n\n\nFrequently the woods are pink,\nFrequently are brown;\nFrequently the hills undress\nBehind my native town.\n\nOft a head is crested\nI was wont to see,\nAnd as oft a cranny\nWhere it used to be.\n\nAnd the earth, they tell me,\nOn its axis turned, —\nWonderful rotation\nBy but twelve performed!\n\n\nA THUNDER-STORM.\n\nThe wind begun to rock the grass\nWith threatening tunes and low, —\nHe flung a menace at the earth,\nA menace at the sky.\n\nThe leaves unhooked themselves from trees\nAnd started all abroad;\nThe dust did scoop itself like hands\nAnd throw away the road.\n\nThe wagons quickened on the streets,\nThe thunder hurried slow;\nThe lightning showed a yellow beak,\nAnd then a livid claw.\n\nThe birds put up the bars to nests,\nThe cattle fled to barns;\nThere came one drop of giant rain,\nAnd then, as if the hands\n\nThat held the dams had parted hold,\nThe waters wrecked the sky,\nBut overlooked my father's house,\nJust quartering a tree.\n\n\nWITH FLOWERS.\n\nSouth winds jostle them,\nBumblebees come,\nHover, hesitate,\nDrink, and are gone.\n\nButterflies pause\nOn their passage Cashmere;\nI, softly plucking,\nPresent them here!\n\n\nSUNSET.\n\nWhere ships of purple gently toss\nOn seas of daffodil,\nFantastic sailors mingle,\nAnd then — the wharf is still.\n\n\nShe sweeps with many-colored brooms,\nAnd leaves the shreds behind;\nOh, housewife in the evening west,\nCome back, and dust the pond!\n\nYou dropped a purple ravelling in,\nYou dropped an amber thread;\nAnd now you 've littered all the East\nWith duds of emerald!\n\nAnd still she plies her spotted brooms,\nAnd still the aprons fly,\nTill brooms fade softly into stars —\nAnd then I come away.\n\n\nLike mighty footlights burned the red\nAt bases of the trees, —\nThe far theatricals of day\nExhibiting to these.\n\n'T was universe that did applaud\nWhile, chiefest of the crowd,\nEnabled by his royal dress,\nMyself distinguished God.\n\n\nPROBLEMS.\n\nBring me the sunset in a cup,\nReckon the morning's flagons up,\nAnd say how many dew;\nTell me how far the morning leaps,\nTell me what time the weaver sleeps\nWho spun the breadths of blue!\n\nWrite me how many notes there be\nIn the new robin's ecstasy\nAmong astonished boughs;\nHow many trips the tortoise makes,\nHow many cups the bee partakes, —\nThe debauchee of dews!\n\nAlso, who laid the rainbow's piers,\nAlso, who leads the docile spheres\nBy withes of supple blue?\nWhose fingers string the stalactite,\nWho counts the wampum of the night,\nTo see that none is due?\n\nWho built this little Alban house\nAnd shut the windows down so close\nMy spirit cannot see?\nWho 'll let me out some gala day,\nWith implements to fly away,\nPassing pomposity?\n\n\nTHE JUGGLER OF DAY.\n\nBlazing in gold and quenching in purple,\nLeaping like leopards to the sky,\nThen at the feet of the old horizon\nLaying her spotted face, to die;\n\nStooping as low as the otter's window,\nTouching the roof and tinting the barn,\nKissing her bonnet to the meadow, —\nAnd the juggler of day is gone!\n\n\nMY CRICKET.\n\nFarther in summer than the birds,\nPathetic from the grass,\nA minor nation celebrates\nIts unobtrusive mass.\n\nNo ordinance is seen,\nSo gradual the grace,\nA pensive custom it becomes,\nEnlarging loneliness.\n\nAntiquest felt at noon\nWhen August, burning low,\nCalls forth this spectral canticle,\nRepose to typify.\n\nRemit as yet no grace,\nNo furrow on the glow,\nYet a druidic difference\nEnhances nature now.\n\n\nAs imperceptibly as grief\nThe summer lapsed away, —\nToo imperceptible, at last,\nTo seem like perfidy.\n\nA quietness distilled,\nAs twilight long begun,\nOr Nature, spending with herself\nSequestered afternoon.\n\nThe dusk drew earlier in,\nThe morning foreign shone, —\nA courteous, yet harrowing grace,\nAs guest who would be gone.\n\nAnd thus, without a wing,\nOr service of a keel,\nOur summer made her light escape\nInto the beautiful.\n\n\nIt can't be summer, — that got through;\nIt 's early yet for spring;\nThere 's that long town of white to cross\nBefore the blackbirds sing.\n\nIt can't be dying, — it's too rouge, —\nThe dead shall go in white.\nSo sunset shuts my question down\nWith clasps of chrysolite.\n\n\nSUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.\n\nThe gentian weaves her fringes,\nThe maple's loom is red.\nMy departing blossoms\nObviate parade.\n\nA brief, but patient illness,\nAn hour to prepare;\nAnd one, below this morning,\nIs where the angels are.\n\nIt was a short procession, —\nThe bobolink was there,\nAn aged bee addressed us,\nAnd then we knelt in prayer.\n\nWe trust that she was willing, —\nWe ask that we may be.\nSummer, sister, seraph,\nLet us go with thee!\n\nIn the name of the bee\nAnd of the butterfly\nAnd of the breeze, amen!\n\n\nFRINGED GENTIAN.\n\nGod made a little gentian;\nIt tried to be a rose\nAnd failed, and all the summer laughed.\nBut just before the snows\nThere came a purple creature\nThat ravished all the hill;\nAnd summer hid her forehead,\nAnd mockery was still.\nThe frosts were her condition;\nThe Tyrian would not come\nUntil the North evoked it.\n\"Creator! shall I bloom?\"\n\n\nNOVEMBER.\n\nBesides the autumn poets sing,\nA few prosaic days\nA little this side of the snow\nAnd that side of the haze.\n\nA few incisive mornings,\nA few ascetic eyes, —\nGone Mr. Bryant's golden-rod,\nAnd Mr. Thomson's sheaves.\n\nStill is the bustle in the brook,\nSealed are the spicy valves;\nMesmeric fingers softly touch\nThe eyes of many elves.\n\nPerhaps a squirrel may remain,\nMy sentiments to share.\nGrant me, O Lord, a sunny mind,\nThy windy will to bear!\n\n\nTHE SNOW.\n\nIt sifts from leaden sieves,\nIt powders all the wood,\nIt fills with alabaster wool\nThe wrinkles of the road.\n\nIt makes an even face\nOf mountain and of plain, —\nUnbroken forehead from the east\nUnto the east again.\n\nIt reaches to the fence,\nIt wraps it, rail by rail,\nTill it is lost in fleeces;\nIt flings a crystal veil\n\nOn stump and stack and stem, —\nThe summer's empty room,\nAcres of seams where harvests were,\nRecordless, but for them.\n\nIt ruffles wrists of posts,\nAs ankles of a queen, —\nThen stills its artisans like ghosts,\nDenying they have been.\n\n\nTHE BLUE JAY.\n\nNo brigadier throughout the year\nSo civic as the jay.\nA neighbor and a warrior too,\nWith shrill felicity\n\nPursuing winds that censure us\nA February day,\nThe brother of the universe\nWas never blown away.\n\nThe snow and he are intimate;\nI 've often seen them play\nWhen heaven looked upon us all\nWith such severity,\n\nI felt apology were due\nTo an insulted sky,\nWhose pompous frown was nutriment\nTo their temerity.\n\nThe pillow of this daring head\nIs pungent evergreens;\nHis larder — terse and militant —\nUnknown, refreshing things;\n\nHis character a tonic,\nHis future a dispute;\nUnfair an immortality\nThat leaves this neighbor out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\n\n\nLet down the bars, O Death!\nThe tired flocks come in\nWhose bleating ceases to repeat,\nWhose wandering is done.\n\nThine is the stillest night,\nThine the securest fold;\nToo near thou art for seeking thee,\nToo tender to be told.\n\n\nGoing to heaven!\nI don't know when,\nPray do not ask me how, —\nIndeed, I 'm too astonished\nTo think of answering you!\nGoing to heaven! —\nHow dim it sounds!\nAnd yet it will be done\nAs sure as flocks go home at night\nUnto the shepherd's arm!\n\nPerhaps you 're going too!\nWho knows?\nIf you should get there first,\nSave just a little place for me\nClose to the two I lost!\n\nThe smallest \"robe\" will fit me,\nAnd just a bit of \"crown;\"\nFor you know we do not mind our dress\nWhen we are going home.\n\nI 'm glad I don't believe it,\nFor it would stop my breath,\nAnd I 'd like to look a little more\nAt such a curious earth!\nI am glad they did believe it\nWhom I have never found\nSince the mighty autumn afternoon\nI left them in the ground.\n\n\nAt least to pray is left, is left.\nO Jesus! in the air\nI know not which thy chamber is, —\nI 'm knocking everywhere.\n\nThou stirrest earthquake in the South,\nAnd maelstrom in the sea;\nSay, Jesus Christ of Nazareth,\nHast thou no arm for me?\n\n\nEPITAPH.\n\nStep lightly on this narrow spot!\nThe broadest land that grows\nIs not so ample as the breast\nThese emerald seams enclose.\n\nStep lofty; for this name is told\nAs far as cannon dwell,\nOr flag subsist, or fame export\nHer deathless syllable.\n\n\nMorns like these we parted;\nNoons like these she rose,\nFluttering first, then firmer,\nTo her fair repose.\n\nNever did she lisp it,\nAnd 't was not for me;\nShe was mute from transport,\nI, from agony!\n\nTill the evening, nearing,\nOne the shutters drew —\nQuick! a sharper rustling!\nAnd this linnet flew!\n\n\nA death-blow is a life-blow to some\nWho, till they died, did not alive become;\nWho, had they lived, had died, but when\nThey died, vitality begun.\n\n\nI read my sentence steadily,\nReviewed it with my eyes,\nTo see that I made no mistake\nIn its extremest clause, —\n\nThe date, and manner of the shame;\nAnd then the pious form\nThat \"God have mercy\" on the soul\nThe jury voted him.\n\nI made my soul familiar\nWith her extremity,\nThat at the last it should not be\nA novel agony,\n\nBut she and Death, acquainted,\nMeet tranquilly as friends,\nSalute and pass without a hint —\nAnd there the matter ends.\n\n\nI have not told my garden yet,\nLest that should conquer me;\nI have not quite the strength now\nTo break it to the bee.\n\nI will not name it in the street,\nFor shops would stare, that I,\nSo shy, so very ignorant,\nShould have the face to die.\n\nThe hillsides must not know it,\nWhere I have rambled so,\nNor tell the loving forests\nThe day that I shall go,\n\nNor lisp it at the table,\nNor heedless by the way\nHint that within the riddle\nOne will walk to-day!\n\n\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD.\n\nThey dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,\nLike petals from a rose,\nWhen suddenly across the June\nA wind with fingers goes.\n\nThey perished in the seamless grass, —\nNo eye could find the place;\nBut God on his repealless list\nCan summon every face.\n\n\nThe only ghost I ever saw\nWas dressed in mechlin, — so;\nHe wore no sandal on his foot,\nAnd stepped like flakes of snow.\nHis gait was soundless, like the bird,\nBut rapid, like the roe;\nHis fashions quaint, mosaic,\nOr, haply, mistletoe.\n\nHis conversation seldom,\nHis laughter like the breeze\nThat dies away in dimples\nAmong the pensive trees.\nOur interview was transient,—\nOf me, himself was shy;\nAnd God forbid I look behind\nSince that appalling day!\n\n\nSome, too fragile for winter winds,\nThe thoughtful grave encloses, —\nTenderly tucking them in from frost\nBefore their feet are cold.\n\nNever the treasures in her nest\nThe cautious grave exposes,\nBuilding where schoolboy dare not look\nAnd sportsman is not bold.\n\nThis covert have all the children\nEarly aged, and often cold, —\nSparrows unnoticed by the Father;\nLambs for whom time had not a fold.\n\n\nAs by the dead we love to sit,\nBecome so wondrous dear,\nAs for the lost we grapple,\nThough all the rest are here, —\n\nIn broken mathematics\nWe estimate our prize,\nVast, in its fading ratio,\nTo our penurious eyes!\n\n\nMEMORIALS.\n\nDeath sets a thing significant\nThe eye had hurried by,\nExcept a perished creature\nEntreat us tenderly\n\nTo ponder little workmanships\nIn crayon or in wool,\nWith \"This was last her fingers did,\"\nIndustrious until\n\nThe thimble weighed too heavy,\nThe stitches stopped themselves,\nAnd then 't was put among the dust\nUpon the closet shelves.\n\nA book I have, a friend gave,\nWhose pencil, here and there,\nHad notched the place that pleased him, —\nAt rest his fingers are.\n\nNow, when I read, I read not,\nFor interrupting tears\nObliterate the etchings\nToo costly for repairs.\n\n\nI went to heaven, —\n'T was a small town,\nLit with a ruby,\nLathed with down.\nStiller than the fields\nAt the full dew,\nBeautiful as pictures\nNo man drew.\nPeople like the moth,\nOf mechlin, frames,\nDuties of gossamer,\nAnd eider names.\nAlmost contented\nI could be\n'Mong such unique\nSociety.\n\n\nTheir height in heaven comforts not,\nTheir glory nought to me;\n'T was best imperfect, as it was;\nI 'm finite, I can't see.\n\nThe house of supposition,\nThe glimmering frontier\nThat skirts the acres of perhaps,\nTo me shows insecure.\n\nThe wealth I had contented me;\nIf 't was a meaner size,\nThen I had counted it until\nIt pleased my narrow eyes\n\nBetter than larger values,\nHowever true their show;\nThis timid life of evidence\nKeeps pleading, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\nThere is a shame of nobleness\nConfronting sudden pelf, —\nA finer shame of ecstasy\nConvicted of itself.\n\nA best disgrace a brave man feels,\nAcknowledged of the brave, —\nOne more \"Ye Blessed\" to be told;\nBut this involves the grave.\n\n\nTRIUMPH.\n\nTriumph may be of several kinds.\nThere 's triumph in the room\nWhen that old imperator, Death,\nBy faith is overcome.\n\nThere 's triumph of the finer mind\nWhen truth, affronted long,\nAdvances calm to her supreme,\nHer God her only throng.\n\nA triumph when temptation's bribe\nIs slowly handed back,\nOne eye upon the heaven renounced\nAnd one upon the rack.\n\nSeverer triumph, by himself\nExperienced, who can pass\nAcquitted from that naked bar,\nJehovah's countenance!\n\n\nPompless no life can pass away;\nThe lowliest career\nTo the same pageant wends its way\nAs that exalted here.\nHow cordial is the mystery!\nThe hospitable pall\nA \"this way\" beckons spaciously, —\nA miracle for all!\n\n\nI noticed people disappeared,\nWhen but a little child, —\nSupposed they visited remote,\nOr settled regions wild.\n\nNow know I they both visited\nAnd settled regions wild,\nBut did because they died, — a fact\nWithheld the little child!\n\n\nFOLLOWING.\n\nI had no cause to be awake,\nMy best was gone to sleep,\nAnd morn a new politeness took,\nAnd failed to wake them up,\n\nBut called the others clear,\nAnd passed their curtains by.\nSweet morning, when I over-sleep,\nKnock, recollect, for me!\n\nI looked at sunrise once,\nAnd then I looked at them,\nAnd wishfulness in me arose\nFor circumstance the same.\n\n'T was such an ample peace,\nIt could not hold a sigh, —\n'T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,\n'T was sunset all the day.\n\nSo choosing but a gown\nAnd taking but a prayer,\nThe only raiment I should need,\nI struggled, and was there.\n\n\nIf anybody's friend be dead,\nIt 's sharpest of the theme\nThe thinking how they walked alive,\nAt such and such a time.\n\nTheir costume, of a Sunday,\nSome manner of the hair, —\nA prank nobody knew but them,\nLost, in the sepulchre.\n\nHow warm they were on such a day:\nYou almost feel the date,\nSo short way off it seems; and now,\nThey 're centuries from that.\n\nHow pleased they were at what you said;\nYou try to touch the smile,\nAnd dip your fingers in the frost:\nWhen was it, can you tell,\n\nYou asked the company to tea,\nAcquaintance, just a few,\nAnd chatted close with this grand thing\nThat don't remember you?\n\nPast bows and invitations,\nPast interview, and vow,\nPast what ourselves can estimate, —\nThat makes the quick of woe!\n\n\nTHE JOURNEY.\n\nOur journey had advanced;\nOur feet were almost come\nTo that odd fork in Being's road,\nEternity by term.\n\nOur pace took sudden awe,\nOur feet reluctant led.\nBefore were cities, but between,\nThe forest of the dead.\n\nRetreat was out of hope, —\nBehind, a sealed route,\nEternity's white flag before,\nAnd God at every gate.\n\n\nA COUNTRY BURIAL.\n\nAmple make this bed.\nMake this bed with awe;\nIn it wait till judgment break\nExcellent and fair.\n\nBe its mattress straight,\nBe its pillow round;\nLet no sunrise' yellow noise\nInterrupt this ground.\n\n\nGOING.\n\nOn such a night, or such a night,\nWould anybody care\nIf such a little figure\nSlipped quiet from its chair,\n\nSo quiet, oh, how quiet!\nThat nobody might know\nBut that the little figure\nRocked softer, to and fro?\n\nOn such a dawn, or such a dawn,\nWould anybody sigh\nThat such a little figure\nToo sound asleep did lie\n\nFor chanticleer to wake it, —\nOr stirring house below,\nOr giddy bird in orchard,\nOr early task to do?\n\nThere was a little figure plump\nFor every little knoll,\nBusy needles, and spools of thread,\nAnd trudging feet from school.\n\nPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts,\nAnd visions vast and small.\nStrange that the feet so precious charged\nShould reach so small a goal!\n\n\nEssential oils are wrung:\nThe attar from the rose\nIs not expressed by suns alone,\nIt is the gift of screws.\n\nThe general rose decays;\nBut this, in lady's drawer,\nMakes summer when the lady lies\nIn ceaseless rosemary.\n\n\nI lived on dread; to those who know\nThe stimulus there is\nIn danger, other impetus\nIs numb and vital-less.\n\nAs 't were a spur upon the soul,\nA fear will urge it where\nTo go without the spectre's aid\nWere challenging despair.\n\n\nIf I should die,\nAnd you should live,\nAnd time should gurgle on,\nAnd morn should beam,\nAnd noon should burn,\nAs it has usual done;\nIf birds should build as early,\nAnd bees as bustling go, —\nOne might depart at option\nFrom enterprise below!\n'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand\nWhen we with daisies lie,\nThat commerce will continue,\nAnd trades as briskly fly.\nIt makes the parting tranquil\nAnd keeps the soul serene,\nThat gentlemen so sprightly\nConduct the pleasing scene!\n\n\nAT LENGTH.\n\nHer final summer was it,\nAnd yet we guessed it not;\nIf tenderer industriousness\nPervaded her, we thought\n\nA further force of life\nDeveloped from within, —\nWhen Death lit all the shortness up,\nAnd made the hurry plain.\n\nWe wondered at our blindness, —\nWhen nothing was to see\nBut her Carrara guide-post, —\nAt our stupidity,\n\nWhen, duller than our dulness,\nThe busy darling lay,\nSo busy was she, finishing,\nSo leisurely were we!\n\n\nGHOSTS.\n\nOne need not be a chamber to be haunted,\nOne need not be a house;\nThe brain has corridors surpassing\nMaterial place.\n\nFar safer, of a midnight meeting\nExternal ghost,\nThan an interior confronting\nThat whiter host.\n\nFar safer through an Abbey gallop,\nThe stones achase,\nThan, moonless, one's own self encounter\nIn lonesome place.\n\nOurself, behind ourself concealed,\nShould startle most;\nAssassin, hid in our apartment,\nBe horror's least.\n\nThe prudent carries a revolver,\nHe bolts the door,\nO'erlooking a superior spectre\nMore near.\n\n\nVANISHED.\n\nShe died, — this was the way she died;\nAnd when her breath was done,\nTook up her simple wardrobe\nAnd started for the sun.\n\nHer little figure at the gate\nThe angels must have spied,\nSince I could never find her\nUpon the mortal side.\n\n\nPRECEDENCE.\n\nWait till the majesty of Death\nInvests so mean a brow!\nAlmost a powdered footman\nMight dare to touch it now!\n\nWait till in everlasting robes\nThis democrat is dressed,\nThen prate about \"preferment\"\nAnd \"station\" and the rest!\n\nAround this quiet courtier\nObsequious angels wait!\nFull royal is his retinue,\nFull purple is his state!\n\nA lord might dare to lift the hat\nTo such a modest clay,\nSince that my Lord, \"the Lord of lords\"\nReceives unblushingly!\n\n\nGONE.\n\nWent up a year this evening!\nI recollect it well!\nAmid no bells nor bravos\nThe bystanders will tell!\nCheerful, as to the village,\nTranquil, as to repose,\nChastened, as to the chapel,\nThis humble tourist rose.\nDid not talk of returning,\nAlluded to no time\nWhen, were the gales propitious,\nWe might look for him;\nWas grateful for the roses\nIn life's diverse bouquet,\nTalked softly of new species\nTo pick another day.\n\nBeguiling thus the wonder,\nThe wondrous nearer drew;\nHands bustled at the moorings —\nThe crowd respectful grew.\nAscended from our vision\nTo countenances new!\nA difference, a daisy,\nIs all the rest I knew!\n\n\nREQUIEM.\n\nTaken from men this morning,\nCarried by men to-day,\nMet by the gods with banners\nWho marshalled her away.\n\nOne little maid from playmates,\nOne little mind from school, —\nThere must be guests in Eden;\nAll the rooms are full.\n\nFar as the east from even,\nDim as the border star, —\nCourtiers quaint, in kingdoms,\nOur departed are.\n\n\nWhat inn is this\nWhere for the night\nPeculiar traveller comes?\nWho is the landlord?\nWhere the maids?\nBehold, what curious rooms!\nNo ruddy fires on the hearth,\nNo brimming tankards flow.\nNecromancer, landlord,\nWho are these below?\n\n\nIt was not death, for I stood up,\nAnd all the dead lie down;\nIt was not night, for all the bells\nPut out their tongues, for noon.\n\nIt was not frost, for on my flesh\nI felt siroccos crawl, —\nNor fire, for just my marble feet\nCould keep a chancel cool.\n\nAnd yet it tasted like them all;\nThe figures I have seen\nSet orderly, for burial,\nReminded me of mine,\n\nAs if my life were shaven\nAnd fitted to a frame,\nAnd could not breathe without a key;\nAnd 't was like midnight, some,\n\nWhen everything that ticked has stopped,\nAnd space stares, all around,\nOr grisly frosts, first autumn morns,\nRepeal the beating ground.\n\nBut most like chaos, — stopless, cool, —\nWithout a chance or spar,\nOr even a report of land\nTo justify despair.\n\n\nTILL THE END.\n\nI should not dare to leave my friend,\nBecause — because if he should die\nWhile I was gone, and I — too late —\nShould reach the heart that wanted me;\n\nIf I should disappoint the eyes\nThat hunted, hunted so, to see,\nAnd could not bear to shut until\nThey \"noticed\" me — they noticed me;\n\nIf I should stab the patient faith\nSo sure I 'd come — so sure I 'd come,\nIt listening, listening, went to sleep\nTelling my tardy name, —\n\nMy heart would wish it broke before,\nSince breaking then, since breaking then,\nWere useless as next morning's sun,\nWhere midnight frosts had lain!\n\n\nVOID.\n\nGreat streets of silence led away\nTo neighborhoods of pause;\nHere was no notice, no dissent,\nNo universe, no laws.\n\nBy clocks 't was morning, and for night\nThe bells at distance called;\nBut epoch had no basis here,\nFor period exhaled.\n\n\nA throe upon the features\nA hurry in the breath,\nAn ecstasy of parting\nDenominated \"Death,\" —\n\nAn anguish at the mention,\nWhich, when to patience grown,\nI 've known permission given\nTo rejoin its own.\n\n\nSAVED!\n\nOf tribulation these are they\nDenoted by the white;\nThe spangled gowns, a lesser rank\nOf victors designate.\n\nAll these did conquer; but the ones\nWho overcame most times\nWear nothing commoner than snow,\nNo ornament but palms.\n\nSurrender is a sort unknown\nOn this superior soil;\nDefeat, an outgrown anguish,\nRemembered as the mile\n\nOur panting ankle barely gained\nWhen night devoured the road;\nBut we stood whispering in the house,\nAnd all we said was \"Saved\"!\n\n\nI think just how my shape will rise\nWhen I shall be forgiven,\nTill hair and eyes and timid head\nAre out of sight, in heaven.\n\nI think just how my lips will weigh\nWith shapeless, quivering prayer\nThat you, so late, consider me,\nThe sparrow of your care.\n\nI mind me that of anguish sent,\nSome drifts were moved away\nBefore my simple bosom broke, —\nAnd why not this, if they?\n\nAnd so, until delirious borne\nI con that thing, — \"forgiven,\" —\nTill with long fright and longer trust\nI drop my heart, unshriven!\n\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.\n\nAfter a hundred years\nNobody knows the place, —\nAgony, that enacted there,\nMotionless as peace.\n\nWeeds triumphant ranged,\nStrangers strolled and spelled\nAt the lone orthography\nOf the elder dead.\n\nWinds of summer fields\nRecollect the way, —\nInstinct picking up the key\nDropped by memory.\n\n\nLay this laurel on the one\nToo intrinsic for renown.\nLaurel! veil your deathless tree, —\nHim you chasten, that is he!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOEMS\n\nby EMILY DICKINSON\n\nThird Series\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited by\n\nMABEL LOOMIS TODD\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all I have to bring to-day,\nThis, and my heart beside,\nThis, and my heart, and all the fields,\nAnd all the meadows wide.\nBe sure you count, should I forget, —\nSome one the sum could tell, —\nThis, and my heart, and all the bees\nWhich in the clover dwell.\n\n\n\nI. LIFE.\n\n\nREAL RICHES.\n\n'T is little I could care for pearls\nWho own the ample sea;\nOr brooches, when the Emperor\nWith rubies pelteth me;\n\nOr gold, who am the Prince of Mines;\nOr diamonds, when I see\nA diadem to fit a dome\nContinual crowning me.\n\n\nSUPERIORITY TO FATE.\n\nSuperiority to fate\nIs difficult to learn.\n'T is not conferred by any,\nBut possible to earn\n\nA pittance at a time,\nUntil, to her surprise,\nThe soul with strict economy\nSubsists till Paradise.\n\n\nHOPE.\n\nHope is a subtle glutton;\nHe feeds upon the fair;\nAnd yet, inspected closely,\nWhat abstinence is there!\n\nHis is the halcyon table\nThat never seats but one,\nAnd whatsoever is consumed\nThe same amounts remain.\n\n\nFORBIDDEN FRU\n\nForbidden fruit a flavor has\nThat lawful orchards mocks;\nHow luscious lies the pea within\nThe pod that Duty locks!\n\n\nFORBIDDEN FRU\n\nHeaven is what I cannot reach!\nThe apple on the tree,\nProvided it do hopeless hang,\nThat 'heaven' is, to me.\n\nThe color on the cruising cloud,\nThe interdicted ground\nBehind the hill, the house behind, —\nThere Paradise is found!\n\n\nA WORD.\n\nA word is dead\nWhen it is said,\nSome say.\nI say it just\nBegins to live\nThat day.\n\n\nTo venerate the simple days\nWhich lead the seasons by,\nNeeds but to remember\nThat from you or me\nThey may take the trifle\nTermed mortality!\n\nTo invest existence with a stately air,\nNeeds but to remember\nThat the acorn there\nIs the egg of forests\nFor the upper air!\n\n\nLIFE'S TRADES.\n\nIt's such a little thing to weep,\nSo short a thing to sigh;\nAnd yet by trades the size of these\nWe men and women die!\n\n\nDrowning is not so pitiful\nAs the attempt to rise.\nThree times, 't is said, a sinking man\nComes up to face the skies,\nAnd then declines forever\nTo that abhorred abode\nWhere hope and he part company, —\nFor he is grasped of God.\nThe Maker's cordial visage,\nHowever good to see,\nIs shunned, we must admit it,\nLike an adversity.\n\n\nHow still the bells in steeples stand,\nTill, swollen with the sky,\nThey leap upon their silver feet\nIn frantic melody!\n\n\nIf the foolish call them 'flowers,'\nNeed the wiser tell?\nIf the savans 'classify' them,\nIt is just as well!\n\nThose who read the Revelations\nMust not criticise\nThose who read the same edition\nWith beclouded eyes!\n\nCould we stand with that old Moses\nCanaan denied, —\nScan, like him, the stately landscape\nOn the other side, —\n\nDoubtless we should deem superfluous\nMany sciences\nNot pursued by learnèd angels\nIn scholastic skies!\n\nLow amid that glad Belles lettres\nGrant that we may stand,\nStars, amid profound Galaxies,\nAt that grand 'Right hand'!\n\n\nA SYLLABLE.\n\nCould mortal lip divine\nThe undeveloped freight\nOf a delivered syllable,\n'T would crumble with the weight.\n\n\nPARTING.\n\nMy life closed twice before its close;\nIt yet remains to see\nIf Immortality unveil\nA third event to me,\n\nSo huge, so hopeless to conceive,\nAs these that twice befell.\nParting is all we know of heaven,\nAnd all we need of hell.\n\n\nASPIRATION.\n\nWe never know how high we are\nTill we are called to rise;\nAnd then, if we are true to plan,\nOur statures touch the skies.\n\nThe heroism we recite\nWould be a daily thing,\nDid not ourselves the cubits warp\nFor fear to be a king.\n\n\nTHE INEVITABLE.\n\nWhile I was fearing it, it came,\nBut came with less of fear,\nBecause that fearing it so long\nHad almost made it dear.\nThere is a fitting a dismay,\nA fitting a despair.\n'Tis harder knowing it is due,\nThan knowing it is here.\nThe trying on the utmost,\nThe morning it is new,\nIs terribler than wearing it\nA whole existence through.\n\n\nA BOOK.\n\nThere is no frigate like a book\nTo take us lands away,\nNor any coursers like a page\nOf prancing poetry.\nThis traverse may the poorest take\nWithout oppress of toll;\nHow frugal is the chariot\nThat bears a human soul!\n\n\nWho has not found the heaven below\nWill fail of it above.\nGod's residence is next to mine,\nHis furniture is love.\n\n\nA PORTRAIT.\n\nA face devoid of love or grace,\nA hateful, hard, successful face,\nA face with which a stone\nWould feel as thoroughly at ease\nAs were they old acquaintances, —\nFirst time together thrown.\n\n\nI HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.\n\nI had a guinea golden;\nI lost it in the sand,\nAnd though the sum was simple,\nAnd pounds were in the land,\nStill had it such a value\nUnto my frugal eye,\nThat when I could not find it\nI sat me down to sigh.\n\nI had a crimson robin\nWho sang full many a day,\nBut when the woods were painted\nHe, too, did fly away.\nTime brought me other robins, —\nTheir ballads were the same, —\nStill for my missing troubadour\nI kept the 'house at hame.'\n\nI had a star in heaven;\nOne Pleiad was its name,\nAnd when I was not heeding\nIt wandered from the same.\nAnd though the skies are crowded,\nAnd all the night ashine,\nI do not care about it,\nSince none of them are mine.\n\nMy story has a moral:\nI have a missing friend, —\nPleiad its name, and robin,\nAnd guinea in the sand, —\nAnd when this mournful ditty,\nAccompanied with tear,\nShall meet the eye of traitor\nIn country far from here,\nGrant that repentance solemn\nMay seize upon his mind,\nAnd he no consolation\nBeneath the sun may find.\n\nNOTE. — This poem may have had, like many others, a\npersonal origin. It is more than probable that it was\nsent to some friend travelling in Europe, a dainty\nreminder of letter-writing delinquencies.\n\n\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON.\n\nFrom all the jails the boys and girls\nEcstatically leap, —\nBeloved, only afternoon\nThat prison doesn't keep.\n\nThey storm the earth and stun the air,\nA mob of solid bliss.\nAlas! that frowns could lie in wait\nFor such a foe as this!\n\n\n\nFew get enough, — enough is one;\nTo that ethereal throng\nHave not each one of us the right\nTo stealthily belong?\n\n\nUpon the gallows hung a wretch,\nToo sullied for the hell\nTo which the law entitled him.\nAs nature's curtain fell\nThe one who bore him tottered in,\nFor this was woman's son.\n''T was all I had,' she stricken gasped;\nOh, what a livid boon!\n\n\nTHE LOST THOUGHT.\n\nI felt a clearing in my mind\nAs if my brain had split;\nI tried to match it, seam by seam,\nBut could not make them fit.\n\nThe thought behind I strove to join\nUnto the thought before,\nBut sequence ravelled out of reach\nLike balls upon a floor.\n\n\nRETICENCE.\n\nThe reticent volcano keeps\nHis never slumbering plan;\nConfided are his projects pink\nTo no precarious man.\n\nIf nature will not tell the tale\nJehovah told to her,\nCan human nature not survive\nWithout a listener?\n\nAdmonished by her buckled lips\nLet every babbler be.\nThe only secret people keep\nIs Immortality.\n\n\nWITH FLOWERS.\n\nIf recollecting were forgetting,\nThen I remember not;\nAnd if forgetting, recollecting,\nHow near I had forgot!\nAnd if to miss were merry,\nAnd if to mourn were gay,\nHow very blithe the fingers\nThat gathered these to-day!\n\n\nThe farthest thunder that I heard\nWas nearer than the sky,\nAnd rumbles still, though torrid noons\nHave lain their missiles by.\nThe lightning that preceded it\nStruck no one but myself,\nBut I would not exchange the bolt\nFor all the rest of life.\nIndebtedness to oxygen\nThe chemist may repay,\nBut not the obligation\nTo electricity.\nIt founds the homes and decks the days,\nAnd every clamor bright\nIs but the gleam concomitant\nOf that waylaying light.\nThe thought is quiet as a flake, —\nA crash without a sound;\nHow life's reverberation\nIts explanation found!\n\n\nOn the bleakness of my lot\nBloom I strove to raise.\nLate, my acre of a rock\nYielded grape and maize.\n\nSoil of flint if steadfast tilled\nWill reward the hand;\nSeed of palm by Lybian sun\nFructified in sand.\n\n\nCONTRAST.\n\nA door just opened on a street —\nI, lost, was passing by —\nAn instant's width of warmth disclosed,\nAnd wealth, and company.\n\nThe door as sudden shut, and I,\nI, lost, was passing by, —\nLost doubly, but by contrast most,\nEnlightening misery.\n\n\n\nFRIENDS.\n\nAre friends delight or pain?\nCould bounty but remain\nRiches were good.\n\nBut if they only stay\nBolder to fly away,\nRiches are sad.\n\n\n\nFIRE.\n\nAshes denote that fire was;\nRespect the grayest pile\nFor the departed creature's sake\nThat hovered there awhile.\n\nFire exists the first in light,\nAnd then consolidates, —\nOnly the chemist can disclose\nInto what carbonates.\n\n\nA MAN.\n\nFate slew him, but he did not drop;\nShe felled — he did not fall —\nImpaled him on her fiercest stakes —\nHe neutralized them all.\n\nShe stung him, sapped his firm advance,\nBut, when her worst was done,\nAnd he, unmoved, regarded her,\nAcknowledged him a man.\n\n\nVENTURES.\n\nFinite to fail, but infinite to venture.\nFor the one ship that struts the shore\nMany's the gallant, overwhelmed creature\nNodding in navies nevermore.\n\n\nGRIEFS.\n\nI measure every grief I meet\nWith analytic eyes;\nI wonder if it weighs like mine,\nOr has an easier size.\n\nI wonder if they bore it long,\nOr did it just begin?\nI could not tell the date of mine,\nIt feels so old a pain.\n\nI wonder if it hurts to live,\nAnd if they have to try,\nAnd whether, could they choose between,\nThey would not rather die.\n\nI wonder if when years have piled —\nSome thousands — on the cause\nOf early hurt, if such a lapse\nCould give them any pause;\n\nOr would they go on aching still\nThrough centuries above,\nEnlightened to a larger pain\nBy contrast with the love.\n\nThe grieved are many, I am told;\nThe reason deeper lies, —\nDeath is but one and comes but once,\nAnd only nails the eyes.\n\nThere's grief of want, and grief of cold, —\nA sort they call 'despair;'\nThere's banishment from native eyes,\nIn sight of native air.\n\nAnd though I may not guess the kind\nCorrectly, yet to me\nA piercing comfort it affords\nIn passing Calvary,\n\nTo note the fashions of the cross,\nOf those that stand alone,\nStill fascinated to presume\nThat some are like my own.\n\n\nI have a king who does not speak;\nSo, wondering, thro' the hours meek\nI trudge the day away,—\nHalf glad when it is night and sleep,\nIf, haply, thro' a dream to peep\nIn parlors shut by day.\n\nAnd if I do, when morning comes,\nIt is as if a hundred drums\nDid round my pillow roll,\nAnd shouts fill all my childish sky,\nAnd bells keep saying 'victory'\nFrom steeples in my soul!\n\nAnd if I don't, the little Bird\nWithin the Orchard is not heard,\nAnd I omit to pray,\n'Father, thy will be done' to-day,\nFor my will goes the other way,\nAnd it were perjury!\n\n\nDISENCHANTMENT.\n\nIt dropped so low in my regard\nI heard it hit the ground,\nAnd go to pieces on the stones\nAt bottom of my mind;\n\nYet blamed the fate that fractured, less\nThan I reviled myself\nFor entertaining plated wares\nUpon my silver shelf.\n\n\nLOST FAITH.\n\nTo lose one's faith surpasses\nThe loss of an estate,\nBecause estates can be\nReplenished, — faith cannot.\n\nInherited with life,\nBelief but once can be;\nAnnihilate a single clause,\nAnd Being's beggary.\n\n\nLOST JOY.\n\nI had a daily bliss\nI half indifferent viewed,\nTill sudden I perceived it stir, —\nIt grew as I pursued,\n\nTill when, around a crag,\nIt wasted from my sight,\nEnlarged beyond my utmost scope,\nI learned its sweetness right.\n\n\nI worked for chaff, and earning wheat\nWas haughty and betrayed.\nWhat right had fields to arbitrate\nIn matters ratified?\n\nI tasted wheat, — and hated chaff,\nAnd thanked the ample friend;\nWisdom is more becoming viewed\nAt distance than at hand.\n\n\nLife, and Death, and Giants\nSuch as these, are still.\nMinor apparatus, hopper of the mill,\nBeetle at the candle,\nOr a fife's small fame,\nMaintain by accident\nThat they proclaim.\n\n\nALPINE GLOW.\n\nOur lives are Swiss, —\nSo still, so cool,\nTill, some odd afternoon,\nThe Alps neglect their curtains,\nAnd we look farther on.\n\nItaly stands the other side,\nWhile, like a guard between,\nThe solemn Alps,\nThe siren Alps,\nForever intervene!\n\n\nREMEMBRANCE.\n\nRemembrance has a rear and front, —\n'T is something like a house;\nIt has a garret also\nFor refuse and the mouse,\n\nBesides, the deepest cellar\nThat ever mason hewed;\nLook to it, by its fathoms\nOurselves be not pursued.\n\n\nTo hang our head ostensibly,\nAnd subsequent to find\nThat such was not the posture\nOf our immortal mind,\n\nAffords the sly presumption\nThat, in so dense a fuzz,\nYou, too, take cobweb attitudes\nUpon a plane of gauze!\n\n\nTHE BRAIN.\n\nThe brain is wider than the sky,\nFor, put them side by side,\nThe one the other will include\nWith ease, and you beside.\n\nThe brain is deeper than the sea,\nFor, hold them, blue to blue,\nThe one the other will absorb,\nAs sponges, buckets do.\n\nThe brain is just the weight of God,\nFor, lift them, pound for pound,\nAnd they will differ, if they do,\nAs syllable from sound.\n\n\nThe bone that has no marrow;\nWhat ultimate for that?\nIt is not fit for table,\nFor beggar, or for cat.\n\nA bone has obligations,\nA being has the same;\nA marrowless assembly\nIs culpabler than shame.\n\nBut how shall finished creatures\nA function fresh obtain? —\nOld Nicodemus' phantom\nConfronting us again!\n\n\nTHE PAST.\n\nThe past is such a curious creature,\nTo look her in the face\nA transport may reward us,\nOr a disgrace.\n\nUnarmed if any meet her,\nI charge him, fly!\nHer rusty ammunition\nMight yet reply!\n\n\nTo help our bleaker parts\nSalubrious hours are given,\nWhich if they do not fit for earth\nDrill silently for heaven.\n\n\nWhat soft, cherubic creatures\nThese gentlewomen are!\nOne would as soon assault a plush\nOr violate a star.\n\nSuch dimity convictions,\nA horror so refined\nOf freckled human nature,\nOf Deity ashamed, —\n\nIt's such a common glory,\nA fisherman's degree!\nRedemption, brittle lady,\nBe so, ashamed of thee.\n\n\nDESIRE.\n\nWho never wanted, — maddest joy\nRemains to him unknown:\nThe banquet of abstemiousness\nSurpasses that of wine.\n\nWithin its hope, though yet ungrasped\nDesire's perfect goal,\nNo nearer, lest reality\nShould disenthrall thy soul.\n\n\nPHILOSOPHY.\n\nIt might be easier\nTo fail with land in sight,\nThan gain my blue peninsula\nTo perish of delight.\n\n\nPOWER.\n\nYou cannot put a fire out;\nA thing that can ignite\nCan go, itself, without a fan\nUpon the slowest night.\n\nYou cannot fold a flood\nAnd put it in a drawer, —\nBecause the winds would find it out,\nAnd tell your cedar floor.\n\n\nA modest lot, a fame petite,\nA brief campaign of sting and sweet\nIs plenty! Is enough!\nA sailor's business is the shore,\nA soldier's — balls. Who asketh more\nMust seek the neighboring life!\n\n\nIs bliss, then, such abyss\nI must not put my foot amiss\nFor fear I spoil my shoe?\n\nI'd rather suit my foot\nThan save my boot,\nFor yet to buy another pair\nIs possible\nAt any fair.\n\nBut bliss is sold just once;\nThe patent lost\nNone buy it any more.\n\n\nEXPERIENCE.\n\nI stepped from plank to plank\nSo slow and cautiously;\nThe stars about my head I felt,\nAbout my feet the sea.\n\nI knew not but the next\nWould be my final inch, —\nThis gave me that precarious gait\nSome call experience.\n\n\nTHANKSGIVING DAY.\n\nOne day is there of the series\nTermed Thanksgiving day,\nCelebrated part at table,\nPart in memory.\n\nNeither patriarch nor pussy,\nI dissect the play;\nSeems it, to my hooded thinking,\nReflex holiday.\n\nHad there been no sharp subtraction\nFrom the early sum,\nNot an acre or a caption\nWhere was once a room,\n\nNot a mention, whose small pebble\nWrinkled any bay, —\nUnto such, were such assembly,\n'T were Thanksgiving day.\n\n\nCHILDISH GRIEFS.\n\nSoftened by Time's consummate plush,\nHow sleek the woe appears\nThat threatened childhood's citadel\nAnd undermined the years!\n\nBisected now by bleaker griefs,\nWe envy the despair\nThat devastated childhood's realm,\nSo easy to repair.\n\n\n\n\n\nII. LOVE.\n\n\nCONSECRATION.\n\nProud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,\nProud of the pain I did not feel till thee,\nProud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,\nNot to partake thy passion, my humility.\n\n\nLOVE'S HUMILITY.\n\nMy worthiness is all my doubt,\nHis merit all my fear,\nContrasting which, my qualities\nDo lowlier appear;\n\nLest I should insufficient prove\nFor his beloved need,\nThe chiefest apprehension\nWithin my loving creed.\n\nSo I, the undivine abode\nOf his elect content,\nConform my soul as 't were a church\nUnto her sacrament.\n\n\nLOVE.\n\nLove is anterior to life,\nPosterior to death,\nInitial of creation, and\nThe exponent of breath.\n\n\nSATISFIED.\n\nOne blessing had I, than the rest\nSo larger to my eyes\nThat I stopped gauging, satisfied,\nFor this enchanted size.\n\nIt was the limit of my dream,\nThe focus of my prayer, —\nA perfect, paralyzing bliss\nContented as despair.\n\nI knew no more of want or cold,\nPhantasms both become,\nFor this new value in the soul,\nSupremest earthly sum.\n\nThe heaven below the heaven above\nObscured with ruddier hue.\nLife's latitude leant over-full;\nThe judgment perished, too.\n\nWhy joys so scantily disburse,\nWhy Paradise defer,\nWhy floods are served to us in bowls, —\nI speculate no more.\n\n\nWITH A FLOWER.\n\nWhen roses cease to bloom, dear,\nAnd violets are done,\nWhen bumble-bees in solemn flight\nHave passed beyond the sun,\n\nThe hand that paused to gather\nUpon this summer's day\nWill idle lie, in Auburn, —\nThen take my flower, pray!\n\n\nSONG.\n\nSummer for thee grant I may be\nWhen summer days are flown!\nThy music still when whippoorwill\nAnd oriole are done!\n\nFor thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb\nAnd sow my blossoms o'er!\nPray gather me, Anemone,\nThy flower forevermore!\n\n\nLOYALTY.\n\nSplit the lark and you'll find the music,\nBulb after bulb, in silver rolled,\nScantily dealt to the summer morning,\nSaved for your ear when lutes be old.\n\nLoose the flood, you shall find it patent,\nGush after gush, reserved for you;\nScarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,\nNow, do you doubt that your bird was true?\n\n\nTo lose thee, sweeter than to gain\nAll other hearts I knew.\n'T is true the drought is destitute,\nBut then I had the dew!\n\nThe Caspian has its realms of sand,\nIts other realm of sea;\nWithout the sterile perquisite\nNo Caspian could be.\n\n\nPoor little heart!\nDid they forget thee?\nThen dinna care!

NATURE.\n\n\nNATURE'S CHANGES.\n\nThe springtime's pallid landscape\nWill glow like bright bouquet,\nThough drifted deep in parian\nThe village lies to-day.\n\nThe lilacs, bending many a year,\nWith purple load will hang;\nThe bees will not forget the tune\nTheir old forefathers sang.\n\nThe rose will redden in the bog,\nThe aster on the hill\nHer everlasting fashion set,\nAnd covenant gentians frill,\n\nTill summer folds her miracle\nAs women do their gown,\nOr priests adjust the symbols\nWhen sacrament is done.\n\n\nTHE TULIP.\n\nShe slept beneath a tree\nRemembered but by me.\nI touched her cradle mute;\nShe recognized the foot,\nPut on her carmine suit, —\nAnd see!\n\n\nA light exists in spring\nNot present on the year\nAt any other period.\nWhen March is scarcely here\n\nA color stands abroad\nOn solitary hills\nThat science cannot overtake,\nBut human nature feels.\n\nIt waits upon the lawn;\nIt shows the furthest tree\nUpon the furthest slope we know;\nIt almost speaks to me.\n\nThen, as horizons step,\nOr noons report away,\nWithout the formula of sound,\nIt passes, and we stay:\n\nA quality of loss\nAffecting our content,\nAs trade had suddenly encroached\nUpon a sacrament.\n\n\nTHE WAKING YEAR.\n\nA lady red upon the hill\nHer annual secret keeps;\nA lady white within the field\nIn placid lily sleeps!\n\nThe tidy breezes with their brooms\nSweep vale, and hill, and tree!\nPrithee, my pretty housewives!\nWho may expected be?\n\nThe neighbors do not yet suspect!\nThe woods exchange a smile —\nOrchard, and buttercup, and bird —\nIn such a little while!\n\nAnd yet how still the landscape stands,\nHow nonchalant the wood,\nAs if the resurrection\nWere nothing very odd!\n\n\nTO MARCH.\n\nDear March, come in!\nHow glad I am!\nI looked for you before.\nPut down your hat —\nYou must have walked —\nHow out of breath you are!\nDear March, how are you?\nAnd the rest?\nDid you leave Nature well?\nOh, March, come right upstairs with me,\nI have so much to tell!\n\nI got your letter, and the birds';\nThe maples never knew\nThat you were coming, — I declare,\nHow red their faces grew!\nBut, March, forgive me —\nAnd all those hills\nYou left for me to hue;\nThere was no purple suitable,\nYou took it all with you.\n\nWho knocks? That April!\nLock the door!\nI will not be pursued!\nHe stayed away a year, to call\nWhen I am occupied.\nBut trifles look so trivial\nAs soon as you have come,\nThat blame is just as dear as praise\nAnd praise as mere as blame.\n\n\nMARCH.\n\nWe like March, his shoes are purple,\nHe is new and high;\nMakes he mud for dog and peddler,\nMakes he forest dry;\nKnows the adder's tongue his coming,\nAnd begets her spot.\nStands the sun so close and mighty\nThat our minds are hot.\nNews is he of all the others;\nBold it were to die\nWith the blue-birds buccaneering\nOn his British sky.\n\n\nDAWN.\n\nNot knowing when the dawn will come\nI open every door;\nOr has it feathers like a bird,\nOr billows like a shore?\n\n\nA murmur in the trees to note,\nNot loud enough for wind;\nA star not far enough to seek,\nNor near enough to find;\n\nA long, long yellow on the lawn,\nA hubbub as of feet;\nNot audible, as ours to us,\nBut dapperer, more sweet;\n\nA hurrying home of little men\nTo houses unperceived, —\nAll this, and more, if I should tell,\nWould never be believed.\n\nOf robins in the trundle bed\nHow many I espy\nWhose nightgowns could not hide the wings,\nAlthough I heard them try!\n\nBut then I promised ne'er to tell;\nHow could I break my word?\nSo go your way and I'll go mine, —\nNo fear you'll miss the road.\n\n\nMorning is the place for dew,\nCorn is made at noon,\nAfter dinner light for flowers,\nDukes for setting sun!\n\n\nTo my quick ear the leaves conferred;\nThe bushes they were bells;\nI could not find a privacy\nFrom Nature's sentinels.\n\nIn cave if I presumed to hide,\nThe walls began to tell;\nCreation seemed a mighty crack\nTo make me visible.\n\n\nA ROSE.\n\nA sepal, petal, and a thorn\nUpon a common summer's morn,\nA flash of dew, a bee or two,\nA breeze\nA caper in the trees, —\nAnd I'm a rose!\n\n\nHigh from the earth I heard a bird;\nHe trod upon the trees\nAs he esteemed them trifles,\nAnd then he spied a breeze,\nAnd situated softly\nUpon a pile of wind\nWhich in a perturbation\nNature had left behind.\nA joyous-going fellow\nI gathered from his talk,\nWhich both of benediction\nAnd badinage partook,\nWithout apparent burden,\nI learned, in leafy wood\nHe was the faithful father\nOf a dependent brood;\nAnd this untoward transport\nHis remedy for care, —\nA contrast to our respites.\nHow different we are!\n\n\nCOBWEBS.\n\nThe spider as an artist\nHas never been employed\nThough his surpassing merit\nIs freely certified\n\nBy every broom and Bridget\nThroughout a Christian land.\nNeglected son of genius,\nI take thee by the hand.\n\n\nA WELL.\n\nWhat mystery pervades a well!\nThe water lives so far,\nLike neighbor from another world\nResiding in a jar.\n\nThe grass does not appear afraid;\nI often wonder he\nCan stand so close and look so bold\nAt what is dread to me.\n\nRelated somehow they may be, —\nThe sedge stands next the sea,\nWhere he is floorless, yet of fear\nNo evidence gives he.\n\nBut nature is a stranger yet;\nThe ones that cite her most\nHave never passed her haunted house,\nNor simplified her ghost.\n\nTo pity those that know her not\nIs helped by the regret\nThat those who know her, know her less\nThe nearer her they get.\n\n\nTo make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, —\nOne clover, and a bee,\nAnd revery.\nThe revery alone will do\nIf bees are few.\n\n\nTHE WIND.\n\nIt's like the light, —\nA fashionless delight\nIt's like the bee, —\nA dateless melody.\n\nIt's like the woods,\nPrivate like breeze,\nPhraseless, yet it stirs\nThe proudest trees.\n\nIt's like the morning, —\nBest when it's done, —\nThe everlasting clocks\nChime noon.\n\n\nA dew sufficed itself\nAnd satisfied a leaf,\nAnd felt, 'how vast a destiny!\nHow trivial is life!'\n\nThe sun went out to work,\nThe day went out to play,\nBut not again that dew was seen\nBy physiognomy.\n\nWhether by day abducted,\nOr emptied by the sun\nInto the sea, in passing,\nEternally unknown.\n\n\nTHE WOODPECKER.\n\nHis bill an auger is,\nHis head, a cap and frill.\nHe laboreth at every tree, —\nA worm his utmost goal.\n\n\nA SNAKE.\n\nSweet is the swamp with its secrets,\nUntil we meet a snake;\n'T is then we sigh for houses,\nAnd our departure take\nAt that enthralling gallop\nThat only childhood knows.\nA snake is summer's treason,\nAnd guile is where it goes.\n\n\nCould I but ride indefinite,\nAs doth the meadow-bee,\nAnd visit only where I liked,\nAnd no man visit me,\n\nAnd flirt all day with buttercups,\nAnd marry whom I may,\nAnd dwell a little everywhere,\nOr better, run away\n\nWith no police to follow,\nOr chase me if I do,\nTill I should jump peninsulas\nTo get away from you, —\n\nI said, but just to be a bee\nUpon a raft of air,\nAnd row in nowhere all day long,\nAnd anchor off the bar,—\nWhat liberty! So captives deem\nWho tight in dungeons are.\n\n\nTHE MOON.\n\nThe moon was but a chin of gold\nA night or two ago,\nAnd now she turns her perfect face\nUpon the world below.\n\nHer forehead is of amplest blond;\nHer cheek like beryl stone;\nHer eye unto the summer dew\nThe likest I have known.\n\nHer lips of amber never part;\nBut what must be the smile\nUpon her friend she could bestow\nWere such her silver will!\n\nAnd what a privilege to be\nBut the remotest star!\nFor certainly her way might pass\nBeside your twinkling door.\n\nHer bonnet is the firmament,\nThe universe her shoe,\nThe stars the trinkets at her belt,\nHer dimities of blue.\n\n\nTHE BAT.\n\nThe bat is dun with wrinkled wings\nLike fallow article,\nAnd not a song pervades his lips,\nOr none perceptible.\n\nHis small umbrella, quaintly halved,\nDescribing in the air\nAn arc alike inscrutable, —\nElate philosopher!\n\nDeputed from what firmament\nOf what astute abode,\nEmpowered with what malevolence\nAuspiciously withheld.\n\nTo his adroit Creator\nAscribe no less the praise;\nBeneficent, believe me,\nHis eccentricities.\n\n\nTHE BALLOON.\n\nYou've seen balloons set, haven't you?\nSo stately they ascend\nIt is as swans discarded you\nFor duties diamond.\n\nTheir liquid feet go softly out\nUpon a sea of blond;\nThey spurn the air as 't were too mean\nFor creatures so renowned.\n\nTheir ribbons just beyond the eye,\nThey struggle some for breath,\nAnd yet the crowd applauds below;\nThey would not encore death.\n\nThe gilded creature strains and spins,\nTrips frantic in a tree,\nTears open her imperial veins\nAnd tumbles in the sea.\n\nThe crowd retire with an oath\nThe dust in streets goes down,\nAnd clerks in counting-rooms observe,\n''T was only a balloon.'\n\n\nEVENING.\n\nThe cricket sang,\nAnd set the sun,\nAnd workmen finished, one by one,\nTheir seam the day upon.\n\nThe low grass loaded with the dew,\nThe twilight stood as strangers do\nWith hat in hand, polite and new,\nTo stay as if, or go.\n\nA vastness, as a neighbor, came, —\nA wisdom without face or name,\nA peace, as hemispheres at home, —\nAnd so the night became.\n\n\nCOCOON.\n\nDrab habitation of whom?\nTabernacle or tomb,\nOr dome of worm,\nOr porch of gnome,\nOr some elf's catacomb?\n\n\nSUNSET.\n\nA sloop of amber slips away\nUpon an ether sea,\nAnd wrecks in peace a purple tar,\nThe son of ecstasy.\n\n\nAURORA.\n\nOf bronze and blaze\nThe north, to-night!\nSo adequate its forms,\nSo preconcerted with itself,\nSo distant to alarms, —\nAn unconcern so sovereign\nTo universe, or me,\nIt paints my simple spirit\nWith tints of majesty,\nTill I take vaster attitudes,\nAnd strut upon my stem,\nDisdaining men and oxygen,\nFor arrogance of them.\n\nMy splendors are menagerie;\nBut their competeless show\nWill entertain the centuries\nWhen I am, long ago,\nAn island in dishonored grass,\nWhom none but daisies know.\n\n\nTHE COMING OF NIGHT.\n\nHow the old mountains drip with sunset,\nAnd the brake of dun!\nHow the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel\nBy the wizard sun!\n\nHow the old steeples hand the scarlet,\nTill the ball is full, —\nHave I the lip of the flamingo\nThat I dare to tell?\n\nThen, how the fire ebbs like billows,\nTouching all the grass\nWith a departing, sapphire feature,\nAs if a duchess pass!\n\nHow a small dusk crawls on the village\nTill the houses blot;\nAnd the odd flambeaux no men carry\nGlimmer on the spot!\n\nNow it is night in nest and kennel,\nAnd where was the wood,\nJust a dome of abyss is nodding\nInto solitude! —\n\nThese are the visions baffled Guido;\nTitian never told;\nDomenichino dropped the pencil,\nPowerless to unfold.\n\n\nAFTERMATH.\n\nThe murmuring of bees has ceased;\nBut murmuring of some\nPosterior, prophetic,\nHas simultaneous come, —\n\nThe lower metres of the year,\nWhen nature's laugh is done, —\nThe Revelations of the book\nWhose Genesis is June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. TIME AND ETERNITY.\n\n\nThis world is not conclusion;\nA sequel stands beyond,\nInvisible, as music,\nBut positive, as sound.\nIt beckons and it baffles;\nPhilosophies don't know,\nAnd through a riddle, at the last,\nSagacity must go.\nTo guess it puzzles scholars;\nTo gain it, men have shown\nContempt of generations,\nAnd crucifixion known.\n\n\nWe learn in the retreating\nHow vast an one\nWas recently among us.\nA perished sun\n\nEndears in the departure\nHow doubly more\nThan all the golden presence\nIt was before!\n\n\nThey say that 'time assuages,' —\nTime never did assuage;\nAn actual suffering strengthens,\nAs sinews do, with age.\n\nTime is a test of trouble,\nBut not a remedy.\nIf such it prove, it prove too\nThere was no malady.\n\n\nWe cover thee, sweet face.\nNot that we tire of thee,\nBut that thyself fatigue of us;\nRemember, as thou flee,\nWe follow thee until\nThou notice us no more,\nAnd then, reluctant, turn away\nTo con thee o'er and o'er,\nAnd blame the scanty love\nWe were content to show,\nAugmented, sweet, a hundred fold\nIf thou would'st take it now.\n\n\nENDING.\n\nThat is solemn we have ended, —\nBe it but a play,\nOr a glee among the garrets,\nOr a holiday,\n\nOr a leaving home; or later,\nParting with a world\nWe have understood, for better\nStill it be unfurled.\n\n\nThe stimulus, beyond the grave\nHis countenance to see,\nSupports me like imperial drams\nAfforded royally.\n\n\nGiven in marriage unto thee,\nOh, thou celestial host!\nBride of the Father and the Son,\nBride of the Holy Ghost!\n\nOther betrothal shall dissolve,\nWedlock of will decay;\nOnly the keeper of this seal\nConquers mortality.\n\n\n\nThat such have died enables us\nThe tranquiller to die;\nThat such have lived, certificate\nFor immortality.\n\n\nThey won't frown always, — some sweet day\nWhen I forget to tease,\nThey'll recollect how cold I looked,\nAnd how I just said 'please.'\n\nThen they will hasten to the door\nTo call the little child,\nWho cannot thank them, for the ice\nThat on her lisping piled.\n\n\nIMMORTALITY.\n\nIt is an honorable thought,\nAnd makes one lift one's hat,\nAs one encountered gentlefolk\nUpon a daily street,\n\nThat we've immortal place,\nThough pyramids decay,\nAnd kingdoms, like the orchard,\nFlit russetly away.\n\n\nThe distance that the dead have gone\nDoes not at first appear;\nTheir coming back seems possible\nFor many an ardent year.\n\nAnd then, that we have followed them\nWe more than half suspect,\nSo intimate have we become\nWith their dear retrospect.\n\n\nHow dare the robins sing,\nWhen men and women hear\nWho since they went to their account\nHave settled with the year! —\nPaid all that life had earned\nIn one consummate bill,\nAnd now, what life or death can do\nIs immaterial.\nInsulting is the sun\nTo him whose mortal light,\nBeguiled of immortality,\nBequeaths him to the night.\nIn deference to him\nExtinct be every hum,\nWhose garden wrestles with the dew,\nAt daybreak overcome!\n\n\nDEATH.\n\nDeath is like the insect\nMenacing the tree,\nCompetent to kill it,\nBut decoyed may be.\n\nBait it with the balsam,\nSeek it with the knife,\nBaffle, if it cost you\nEverything in life.\n\nThen, if it have burrowed\nOut of reach of skill,\nRing the tree and leave it, —\n'T is the vermin's will.\n\n\nUNWARNED.\n\n'T is sunrise, little maid, hast thou\nNo station in the day?\n'T was not thy wont to hinder so, —\nRetrieve thine industry.\n\n'T is noon, my little maid, alas!\nAnd art thou sleeping yet?\nThe lily waiting to be wed,\nThe bee, dost thou forget?\n\nMy little maid, 't is night; alas,\nThat night should be to thee\nInstead of morning!

Come! My dazzled face\nIn such a shining place!\n\nMe! Hear! My foreign ear\nThe sounds of welcome near!\n\nThe saints shall meet\nOur bashful feet.\n\nMy holiday shall be\nThat they remember me;\n\nMy paradise, the fame\nThat they pronounce my name.\n\n\nINVISIBLE.\n\nFrom us she wandered now a year,\nHer tarrying unknown;\nIf wilderness prevent her feet,\nOr that ethereal zone\n\nNo eye hath seen and lived,\nWe ignorant must be.\nWe only know what time of year\nWe took the mystery.\n\n\n\nI wish I knew that woman's name,\nSo, when she comes this way,\nTo hold my life, and hold my ears,\nFor fear I hear her say\n\nShe's 'sorry I am dead,' again,\nJust when the grave and I\nHave sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, —\nOur only lullaby.\n\n\nTRYING TO FORGET.\n\nBereaved of all, I went abroad,\nNo less bereaved to be\nUpon a new peninsula, —\nThe grave preceded me,\n\nObtained my lodgings ere myself,\nAnd when I sought my bed,\nThe grave it was, reposed upon\nThe pillow for my head.\n\nI waked, to find it first awake,\nI rose, — it followed me;\nI tried to drop it in the crowd,\nTo lose it in the sea,\n\nIn cups of artificial drowse\nTo sleep its shape away, —\nThe grave was finished, but the spade\nRemained in memory.\n\n\nI felt a funeral in my brain,\nAnd mourners, to and fro,\nKept treading, treading, till it seemed\nThat sense was breaking through.\n\nAnd when they all were seated,\nA service like a drum\nKept beating, beating, till I thought\nMy mind was going numb.\n\nAnd then I heard them lift a box,\nAnd creak across my soul\nWith those same boots of lead, again.\nThen space began to toll\n\nAs all the heavens were a bell,\nAnd Being but an ear,\nAnd I and silence some strange race,\nWrecked, solitary, here.\n\n\nI meant to find her when I came;\nDeath had the same design;\nBut the success was his, it seems,\nAnd the discomfit mine.\n\nI meant to tell her how I longed\nFor just this single time;\nBut Death had told her so the first,\nAnd she had hearkened him.\n\nTo wander now is my abode;\nTo rest, — to rest would be\nA privilege of hurricane\nTo memory and me.\n\n\nWAITING.\n\nI sing to use the waiting,\nMy bonnet but to tie,\nAnd shut the door unto my house;\nNo more to do have I,\n\nTill, his best step approaching,\nWe journey to the day,\nAnd tell each other how we sang\nTo keep the dark away.\n\n\nA sickness of this world it most occasions\nWhen best men die;\nA wishfulness their far condition\nTo occupy.\n\nA chief indifference, as foreign\nA world must be\nThemselves forsake contented,\nFor Deity.\n\n\nSuperfluous were the sun\nWhen excellence is dead;\nHe were superfluous every day,\nFor every day is said\n\nThat syllable whose faith\nJust saves it from despair,\nAnd whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates\nIf love inquire, 'Where?'\n\nUpon his dateless fame\nOur periods may lie,\nAs stars that drop anonymous\nFrom an abundant sky.\n\n\nSo proud she was to die\nIt made us all ashamed\nThat what we cherished, so unknown\nTo her desire seemed.\n\nSo satisfied to go\nWhere none of us should be,\nImmediately, that anguish stooped\nAlmost to jealousy.\n\n\nFAREWELL.\n\nTie the strings to my life, my Lord,\nThen I am ready to go!\nJust a look at the horses —\nRapid! That will do!\n\nPut me in on the firmest side,\nSo I shall never fall;\nFor we must ride to the Judgment,\nAnd it's partly down hill.\n\nBut never I mind the bridges,\nAnd never I mind the sea;\nHeld fast in everlasting race\nBy my own choice and thee.\n\nGood-by to the life I used to live,\nAnd the world I used to know;\nAnd kiss the hills for me, just once;\nNow I am ready to go!\n\n\nThe dying need but little, dear, —\nA glass of water's all,\nA flower's unobtrusive face\nTo punctuate the wall,\n\nA fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,\nAnd certainly that one\nNo color in the rainbow\nPerceives when you are gone.\n\n\nDEAD.\n\nThere's something quieter than sleep\nWithin this inner room!\nIt wears a sprig upon its breast,\nAnd will not tell its name.\n\nSome touch it and some kiss it,\nSome chafe its idle hand;\nIt has a simple gravity\nI do not understand!\n\nWhile simple-hearted neighbors\nChat of the 'early dead,'\nWe, prone to periphrasis,\nRemark that birds have fled!\n\n\nThe soul should always stand ajar,\nThat if the heaven inquire,\nHe will not be obliged to wait,\nOr shy of troubling her.\n\nDepart, before the host has slid\nThe bolt upon the door,\nTo seek for the accomplished guest, —\nHer visitor no more.\n\n\nThree weeks passed since I had seen her, —\nSome disease had vexed;\n'T was with text and village singing\nI beheld her next,\n\nAnd a company — our pleasure\nTo discourse alone;\nGracious now to me as any,\nGracious unto none.\n\nBorne, without dissent of either,\nTo the parish night;\nOf the separated people\nWhich are out of sight?\n\n\nI breathed enough to learn the trick,\nAnd now, removed from air,\nI simulate the breath so well,\nThat one, to be quite sure\n\nThe lungs are stirless, must descend\nAmong the cunning cells,\nAnd touch the pantomime himself.\nHow cool the bellows feels!\n\n\nI wonder if the sepulchre\nIs not a lonesome way,\nWhen men and boys, and larks and June\nGo down the fields to hay!\n\n\nJOY IN DEATH.\n\nIf tolling bell I ask the cause.\n'A soul has gone to God,'\nI'm answered in a lonesome tone;\nIs heaven then so sad?\n\nThat bells should joyful ring to tell\nA soul had gone to heaven,\nWould seem to me the proper way\nA good news should be given.\n\n\nIf I may have it when it's dead\nI will contented be;\nIf just as soon as breath is out\nIt shall belong to me,\n\nUntil they lock it in the grave,\n'T is bliss I cannot weigh,\nFor though they lock thee in the grave,\nMyself can hold the key.\n\nThink of it, lover! I and thee\nPermitted face to face to be;\nAfter a life, a death we'll say, —\nFor death was that, and this is thee.\n\n\nBefore the ice is in the pools,\nBefore the skaters go,\nOr any cheek at nightfall\nIs tarnished by the snow,\n\nBefore the fields have finished,\nBefore the Christmas tree,\nWonder upon wonder\nWill arrive to me!\n\nWhat we touch the hems of\nOn a summer's day;\nWhat is only walking\nJust a bridge away;\n\nThat which sings so, speaks so,\nWhen there's no one here, —\nWill the frock I wept in\nAnswer me to wear?\n\n\nDYING.\n\nI heard a fly buzz when I died;\nThe stillness round my form\nWas like the stillness in the air\nBetween the heaves of storm.\n\nThe eyes beside had wrung them dry,\nAnd breaths were gathering sure\nFor that last onset, when the king\nBe witnessed in his power.\n\nI willed my keepsakes, signed away\nWhat portion of me I\nCould make assignable, — and then\nThere interposed a fly,\n\nWith blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,\nBetween the light and me;\nAnd then the windows failed, and then\nI could not see to see.\n\n\nAdrift! A little boat adrift!\nAnd night is coming down!\nWill no one guide a little boat\nUnto the nearest town?\n\nSo sailors say, on yesterday,\nJust as the dusk was brown,\nOne little boat gave up its strife,\nAnd gurgled down and down.\n\nBut angels say, on yesterday,\nJust as the dawn was red,\nOne little boat o'erspent with gales\nRetrimmed its masts, redecked its sails\nExultant, onward sped!\n\n\nThere's been a death in the opposite house\nAs lately as to-day.\nI know it by the numb look\nSuch houses have alway.\n\nThe neighbors rustle in and out,\nThe doctor drives away.\nA window opens like a pod,\nAbrupt, mechanically;\n\nSomebody flings a mattress out, —\nThe children hurry by;\nThey wonder if It died on that, —\nI used to when a boy.\n\nThe minister goes stiffly in\nAs if the house were his,\nAnd he owned all the mourners now,\nAnd little boys besides;\n\nAnd then the milliner, and the man\nOf the appalling trade,\nTo take the measure of the house.\nThere'll be that dark parade\n\nOf tassels and of coaches soon;\nIt's easy as a sign, —\nThe intuition of the news\nIn just a country town.\n\n\nWe never know we go, — when we are going\nWe jest and shut the door;\nFate following behind us bolts it,\nAnd we accost no more.\n\n\nTHE SOUL'S STORM.\n\nIt struck me every day\nThe lightning was as new\nAs if the cloud that instant slit\nAnd let the fire through.\n\nIt burned me in the night,\nIt blistered in my dream;\nIt sickened fresh upon my sight\nWith every morning's beam.\n\nI thought that storm was brief, —\nThe maddest, quickest by;\nBut Nature lost the date of this,\nAnd left it in the sky.\n\n\nWater is taught by thirst;\nLand, by the oceans passed;\nTransport, by throe;\nPeace, by its battles told;\nLove, by memorial mould;\nBirds, by the snow.\n\n\nTHIRST.\n\nWe thirst at first, — 't is Nature's act;\nAnd later, when we die,\nA little water supplicate\nOf fingers going by.\n\nIt intimates the finer want,\nWhose adequate supply\nIs that great water in the west\nTermed immortality.\n\n\nA clock stopped — not the mantel's;\nGeneva's farthest skill\nCan't put the puppet bowing\nThat just now dangled still.\n\nAn awe came on the trinket!\nThe figures hunched with pain,\nThen quivered out of decimals\nInto degreeless noon.\n\nIt will not stir for doctors,\nThis pendulum of snow;\nThe shopman importunes it,\nWhile cool, concernless No\n\nNods from the gilded pointers,\nNods from the seconds slim,\nDecades of arrogance between\nThe dial life and him.\n\n\nCHARLOTTE BRONTË'S GRAVE.\n\nAll overgrown by cunning moss,\nAll interspersed with weed,\nThe little cage of 'Currer Bell,'\nIn quiet Haworth laid.\n\nThis bird, observing others,\nWhen frosts too sharp became,\nRetire to other latitudes,\nQuietly did the same,\n\nBut differed in returning;\nSince Yorkshire hills are green,\nYet not in all the nests I meet\nCan nightingale be seen.\n\nGathered from many wanderings,\nGethsemane can tell\nThrough what transporting anguish\nShe reached the asphodel!\n\nSoft fall the sounds of Eden\nUpon her puzzled ear;\nOh, what an afternoon for heaven,\nWhen 'Brontë' entered there!\n\n\nA toad can die of light!\nDeath is the common right\nOf toads and men, —\nOf earl and midge\nThe privilege.\nWhy swagger then?\nThe gnat's supremacy\nIs large as thine.\n\n\nFar from love the Heavenly Father\nLeads the chosen child;\nOftener through realm of briar\nThan the meadow mild,\n\nOftener by the claw of dragon\nThan the hand of friend,\nGuides the little one predestined\nTo the native land.\n\n\nSLEEPING.\n\nA long, long sleep, a famous sleep\nThat makes no show for dawn\nBy stretch of limb or stir of lid, —\nAn independent one.\n\nWas ever idleness like this?\nWithin a hut of stone\nTo bask the centuries away\nNor once look up for noon?\n\n\nRETROSPECT.\n\n'T was just this time last year I died.\nI know I heard the corn,\nWhen I was carried by the farms, —\nIt had the tassels on.\n\nI thought how yellow it would look\nWhen Richard went to mill;\nAnd then I wanted to get out,\nBut something held my will.\n\nI thought just how red apples wedged\nThe stubble's joints between;\nAnd carts went stooping round the fields\nTo take the pumpkins in.\n\nI wondered which would miss me least,\nAnd when Thanksgiving came,\nIf father'd multiply the plates\nTo make an even sum.\n\nAnd if my stocking hung too high,\nWould it blur the Christmas glee,\nThat not a Santa Claus could reach\nThe altitude of me?\n\nBut this sort grieved myself, and so\nI thought how it would be\nWhen just this time, some perfect year,\nThemselves should come to me.\n\n\nETERNITY.\n\nOn this wondrous sea,\nSailing silently,\nHo! pilot, ho!\nKnowest thou the shore\nWhere no breakers roar,\nWhere the storm is o'er?\n\nIn the silent west\nMany sails at rest,\nTheir anchors fast;\nThither I pilot thee, —\nLand, ho! Eternity!\nAshore at last!"
